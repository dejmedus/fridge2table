Carrots and cabbage take a little longer to cook so I put them in first and then the rest of the veg goes in a couple of minutes later.\n\n\nKeep giving the veg a stir and turning it over so it cooks evenly and doesn\u2019t stick. It should take 5 \u2013 10 mins to cook through.\n\n\nAdd the miso, five spice and soy sauce and stir through. Finally, add the rice. Stir regularly so it doesn\u2019t burn. Once the rice is heated through, you are good to go.\n\n"

        "instructions": "\nMakes 2 individual 8\u2033 pizzas\nEquipment\n\nFood processor with dough blade\nPizza stone or tray\nMeasuring cups\nMeasuring spoons\nFrying pan\n\n\nAdd all of the flours, yeast*, salt and chipotle mora to the food processor with the dough blade and turn on.\n*I only had dried active yeast to hand, so added it to the ingredients above, (ignoring the actual instructions on the container)\u00a0with full success!\nPour the water in a steady trickle until you\u2019ve used it all and the dough becomes a ball.\nTake the dough out of the processor, lightly flour your surface and set the timer for 10 mins. Knead and stretch the dough the whole time \u2013 if your arms start to ache, just image the amazing workout you\u2019re giving them without stepping inside a gym!\nOnce the timer goes off, shape into a ball, put into a deep bowl that\u2019s had a light sprinkling of flour on the bottom, cover with cling film and leave to rest at room temperature for 10 minutes.\nOnce rested, take it out of the bowl and knead again for 10 seconds \u2013 this helps to develop the flavour and the gluten.\nDivide into 2 equally sized, smooth balls of dough and put into a deep baking dish, lightly sprinkled with flour. Make sure the dish is big enough for them to spread up to twice their size because as the gluten relaxes, they will spread to some degree.\n* Top Tip *\nI\u2019ve made this base numerous times and sometimes the dough spreads a lot, other times it hardly spreads at all. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s always tasted great either way!\nLeave to rest at room temperature overnight, or if you\u2019re in a massive hurry, at least eight hours! I don\u2019t leave mine in a very warm place like the airing cupboard as I found it can dry out and form a \u2018skin\u2019 on the outside.\n* Top Tip *\nThe resting time for the dough is ideally 24 hours, but 48 hours is maximum.\nPut the normal blade back into your food processor and add in the tomatoes, onion, garlic and ancho poblano, pulse for 10-20 seconds to break them up into small chunks, and pour into your frying pan.\n* Top Tip *\nYou can choose how chunky or smooth to have the sauce when pulsing in the processor. Personally I prefer it chunky as it almost becomes one of the delicious pizza toppings.\nAdd the water, balsamic and simmer on a medium heat for 12-15 mins to let the flavours intensify, while stirring occasionally. It\u2019s ready when the excess liquid has been absorbed but it\u2019s still moist; don\u2019t let it dry out and stick to the pan.\n* Top Tip *\nThe sauce flavours will develop the longer you leave it, so why not make it a couple of days in advance and keep in the fridge? It does however, also tastes great if you make it on the day.\nTurn the oven on to the highest setting to heat up your pizza stone if you have one, otherwise 220c if you\u2019re using a pizza tray.\n* Top Tip *\nFor pizza stones, it\u2019s always the hotter the better, so I usually pre-heat mine for an hour.\nLightly flour your surface, roll out the dough, add sauce and your favourite tasty toppings. Put into the oven for approx. 8 mins on the pizza stone. I haven\u2019t cooked them on a pizza tray before, but as it won\u2019t have the intense heat of the stone, I\u2019d suggest 10-12 mins (keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn\u2019t overcook on top).\n* Serving Suggestion *\nThese chilli pizzas are a spicy alternative to your usual takeaway version \u2013 the base has a delicious hot and smokey bite to it, yet this is balanced perfectly by the sweet flavours of the tomato sauce. Throw a pizza party and impress your friends with your cooking skills, or snuggle up on the sofa with your loved one and enjoy all to yourselves!\nI honestly don\u2019t miss cheese on pizza once I throw on a mix of veggies, Dee\u2019s vegan sausage and lots of hot, sweet roquito peppers \u2013 what\u2019s on your list of ultimate pizza toppings?\n"

        "instructions": "\n\nPreheat the oven to 200\u00b0C / 400\u00b0F / Gas Mark 6.\nTo prepare the butternut, begin by peeling with a sharp knife. I find the easiest way to do this is to first slice off the ends, followed by cutting it in half across the middle. You can now slice the skin off from top to bottom on each half. Once peeled, cut each half lengthways through the middle and scoop the seeds and stringy bits from the bottom half. Now slice each segment thinly, so you have lots of half crescent \u2018pasta\u2019 sheets.\nLay the butternut slices on an oven tray and drizzle over the olive oil and maple syrup. Chop the sage leaves into 1cm wide ribbons and sprinkle these on with some black pepper. Cook in the oven for 25 minutes.\nWhile the butternut slices are cooking, prepare the tomato sauce. Finely chop the red onion, garlic and chilli and chop the mushrooms into quarters. Heat the olive oil on a medium heat in a large pan and add the spices: cooking these first releases the flavours. Add the onion, garlic, chilli and mushrooms and cook for about 10 minutes (or when slightly browned and soft).\nChop the tomatoes into small chunks and add these to the pan with the pepper/tomato paste, red wine and vinegar. Simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until reduced. It should be thick, but still loose. Add the black pepper towards the end of cooking.\nWhile the tomato sauce is reducing you can make the white sauce. Heat the olive oil on a medium heat in a saucepan and add the spices and garlic. Keep an eye on the garlic \u2013 you want it to brown lightly but not burn. Once the garlic has begun to colour stir in the flour \u2013 much like making a roux for a b\u00e9chamel sauce. Stir for a minute and then add the milk to create a sauce, continuing to stir. Next, add the tofu and mash it into the sauce using the back of the spoon. You can now stir in the remaining ingredients and leave to simmer for 10 minutes. Again, it should be thick but loose.\nFinally, wilt the spinach by putting it in a pan on a low heat. Give it a stir and drain the water- this only takes about 5 minutes.\nNow for the assembly! Layer the ingredients in a deep dish or tin. I put mine together in the following order: tomato sauce, white sauce, spinach and sausage slices, butternut squash. Repeat until you have used all the ingredients and finish with a sprinkling of cheese.\nCook in the oven for 20 minutes, or until the top is nice and crisp. Let it stand for 5 minutes before serving, so that the layers hold their shape.\nWonderful! Serve with steamed greens and a Miso dressing, which work really well as a contrasting tang to all of the earthy flavours of the lasagne.\n\nLove this recipe? There\u2019s more where that came from!

If you don\u2019t do this they will take a lot longer to cook.\n\n\nPeel, wash and put your potatoes on to boil.\n\n\nFinely dice your onions, carrots, celery and mushrooms and crush your garlic.\n\n\nPut a casserole pot on a medium heat and add your soya butter.\n\n\nWhen melted add the onions and sweat them off until they start to go translucent.\n\n\nAdd the garlic and sweat until both the onion and garlic are soft and translucent.\n\n\nAdd the rest of the veg and cook for another 10 minutes \u2013 stirring constantly.\n\n\nWhen the veg has softened and started to brown add in your flour and stir through so it coats the veg.\n\n\nThen add the flavourings \u2013 salt, pepper, cinnamon, mixed herbs and parsley. Stir these through.\n\n\nMake 500ml of stock using your water and vegetable stock cube.\n\n\nMix the tomato puree into the stock.\n\n\nThen start adding your stock to the veg very slowly. Every time your pour some stock into the veg stir it through until it has absorbed and slightly thickened.\n\n\nThen drain your lentils and them to the pot and stir through.\n\n\nIf this makes the mixture too dry add some more boiling water in small amounts. If you need to add a lot of water you can throw in another half a stock cube so you don\u2019t dilute all the flavour.\n\n\nLeave the mixture to simmer for around 40-45 minutes but check it and stir it constantly to make sure it doesn\u2019t burn. Keep the heat low to avoid this happening.\n\n\nAdd in a about a tablespoon of brown sauce at the end of the cooking process and stir it though.\n\n\nWhen the lentil mix is cooked through add it to your baking dish.\n\n\nMash your potatoes with soya butter and unsweetened soya milk or another plant milk (I would not recommend anything sweet or almond milk).\n\n\nSpread the mashed potato over the top of the lentil mix, smoothing it out with a fork. We added some parsley on top.\n\n\nIf you have any Violife cheese you could add this over the top but that is optional.\n\n\nThen bake the shepherd\u2019s pie a hot oven for 20-30 minutes until the potato starts to go golden brown. If you don\u2019t bake it until the following day it will need longer.\n\n\nWhen it\u2019s ready put your hands together and give thanks that NO animal was harmed in the making of your dinner and enjoy!\n\nLike this recipe?

        "ingredients": "\n\nFor the socca:\n200g chickpea/gram flour\n300ml water\nOlive oil for cooking \u2013 see note\nFor the hot filling:\n1 chipotle chilli\n1 tsp olive oil\n1 red onion\n4 cloves garlic\n1 tin pinto beans (400g / drained weight 240g), rinsed and drained\n1 medium tomato\n1 tsp ground cumin\n1 tsp smoked paprika\n2 tsp good soy sauce or aminos\nFor the peach salsa:\n1 avocado\n4 saturn peaches or 1 regular peach\n2 medium tomatoes\nJuice of 1 lime (preferably organic)\nHandful of fresh coriander stems & leaves\n4 romaine or gem lettuce leaves\n\n",
        "instructions": "\n\nMake the socca batter by sifting the chickpea flour into a bowl. Combine with the water by hand-whisking (using a fork is fine) to ensure there are no lumps and it\u2019s nice and bubbly. Set aside.\nPlace the chipotle chilli in a bowl with boiling water and set aside.\nTo make the salsa, chop the avocado, peaches and tomatoes into small chunks and combine in a bowl with the lime juice and finely chopped coriander.\nCut the lettuce into fine ribbons and place in a bowl.\nRemove the chipotle chilli from the water and remove the seeds and membrane (if you don\u2019t do this your mouth will be on fire!). Finely chop the rest.\nHeat the olive oil in a frying pan while you chop the onion, garlic and tomato. Add these and the chipotle to the pan and cook until the onions become translucent \u2013 about 5 minutes. Add the cumin and paprika, give it a stir and then add the pinto beans. While this is cooking you can make the socca tacos.\nPlace a good, non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, adding a little oil if needed (see note). Once the pan is hot, spoon in some of the socca batter. I find a large serving spoon is about the right amount \u2013 making about 6 tortillas.\nWait for bubbles to appear in the batter. Once they have all popped, flip the tortilla over and allow the other side to cook \u2013 about 2 minutes on each side.\nPop them on a plate ready to serve.\nThe hot filling will also be ready by now, transfer this to a serving bowl.\n\nI like to serve these by setting out all the dishes on the table for a DIY dinner \u2013 it\u2019s much more fun!\nNOTES:\u00a0I recently acquired a ceramic frying pan which is perfect for this recipe. You can make pancakes \u2013 and everything else \u2013 without the need for a single drop of oil! If your pan is not super non-stick, use a little oil for the socca, as you would for regular pancakes.\u00a0If you don\u2019t want to be cooking the hot filling and the socca tortillas at the same time, make the tortillas first and set aside on a plate \u2013 they don\u2019t need to be hot to serve.\u00a0I\u2019ve suggested using organic limes because not only do they taste great, but they are unwaxed (which is particularly important if you\u2019re using the zest).\n"

Pour back into the bowl with the rest of your raspberry puree, and add the Grand Marnier, too. Whisk until incorporated.\nFollow the instructions on your ice cream maker for the rest. This batch went through mine for between 15-20 minutes.\nMakes approximately 1 quart.\n\nBy Lizz Clements\n"

Place the rice in a small saucepan with 220ml of water, bring up to a boil, lower the heat to a gentle simmer, cover and cook for 15 minutes until all the water has been absorbed.\n2. Drain and wrap the tofu in kitchen paper then place between two plates with something heavy on top like a couple of tins. Leave to press for 20 minutes. This process allows the tofu to take on more flavour.\n3. Preheat the oven to 190 degrees celsius.\n4. Prepare the peanut sauce. Mix the peanut butter with 1 tbsp of soy sauce, 1.5 tbsp of mirin, 1 tsp of sesame oil and 1 tbsp of water. Peel and finely chop or grate the garlic, then add to the sauce. Your sauce should be the consistency of single cream. If necessary add a splash more of water to loosen.\n5. Prepare the filling. Cut the avocado in half, remove the pit and scoop the flesh away from the skin, keeping the shape intact. Cut the avocado into strips lengthways. Peel and grate the carrot. Divide both into 4 equal portions. Cut the tofu into 8 slices and coat with 1 tsp of soy sauce. Place the coated tofu on a tray and bake in the oven for 8 minutes.\n6. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan over a high heat for 1 minute or until golden, then tip onto a small plate.\n7. Cool the rice. When the rice is cooked, take it off the heat and mix in 1.5 tbsp of rice wine vinegar, \u00bd a tsp of salt, \u00bd a tsp of sugar and most of the toasted sesame seeds, saving a sprinkle for garnishing. Spread the rice onto a plate and leave to cool, then divide into 4 equal portions.\n8. After 8 minutes, take the tofu out of the oven and coat with half of the peanut sauce. Bake for another 10 minutes then remove from the oven and slice each strip in half lengthways.\n9. Start rolling! Place a small bowl of water nearby. Lay 2 layers of clingfilm larger than the nori sheet over your clean chopping board. Place the nori on top of the clingfilm in portrait orientation. Using your hands, take one portion of rice and spread it evenly onto the half of the nori sheet closest to you, leaving a 1cm gap at the edge of the sheet. Wet your fingertips to stop the rice sticking to your hands.\n10. Place your strips of tofu with a portion of avocado and carrots horizontally in the centre of the rice. Drizzle a little of the peanut sauce over the filling, then start rolling the sushi by placing your thumbs underneath the clingfilm and lifting the edge that is closest to you up and over the filling in the centre. Curve the rest of your fingers over the clingfilm and gently press against the length of the roll, squeezing the rice and filling together inside. Continue to roll the sushi away from you until you\u2019ve rolled past the furthest edge of the nori sheet. You may need to use a little water to seal the edge. Repeat until you get 4 sushi rolls.\n11. Use a sharp knife to cut each roll in half, then each half into 3 equal pieces. Rinse under the tap between slices to help get a clean cut. Garnish the sushi rolls with a sprinkling of the reserved sesame seeds and serve with the remaining soy sauce for dipping.\nTop Tip: if you have a bamboo sushi mat, use it instead of this clingfilm method.\n"

        "instructions": "\n\nAt least an hour before you start cooking, prepare the marinade by combining all the ingredients in a food processor and blending until combined.\nCut the tofu into 1cm pieces, place in a container and cover with the marinade. Leave in the fridge until required.\nThinly slice and de-seed the pepper, slice the carrot into thin batons, chop the coriander (leaves and stems) and slice the spring onions. Put these in a large bowl with the beansprouts, black sesame seeds and the remaining squeeze of lime.\nThinly slice the onion and cut the broccoli lengthways to have even thinner stems.\n\n\n\nHeat a large frying pan on the hob to a medium temperature. Toast the pecans until they begin to turn brown, add in the desiccated coconut and continue to toast until this turns brown too. Remove immediately and put aside in a bowl.\nAdd the coconut oil to the pan and mince the garlic into it, then add the onion. Cook for a few minutes until they begin to soften and brown.\nAdd in the tofu, with the marinade, and give it all a good stir. After a couple of minutes, I like to spoon some of the marinade out into the bowl with the raw ingredients, so that they\u2019re nicely coated in all of the lovely flavours.\nAdd the broccoli to the pan and cook until wilted, and most of the marinade has been soaked up.\nRemove from the heat, stir into the large bowl with the salad, and serve with a sprinkling of the toasted pecans and coconut.\n\nNOTES\nIf you are unable to find tenderstem broccoli, regular broccoli, green beans or pak choi will also work really well.\n"

Whisk together the sesame oil, ginger, wine, five spice, black pepper and soy sauce and pour over the jackfruit. Roast for 15\u201320 minutes or until very tender \u2013 there may still be liquid in the tin, and that\u2019s okay.\nUnwrap the dough, roll it into a log and divide into 12.\nRoll each piece of dough into a ball, then flatten slightly by patting it with the palm of your hand. Brush a thin layer of oil over six of the flattened dough balls, then place the unoiled dough balls on top of them to form sandwiches. Use a rolling pin to roll out each sandwich into a flat pancake, flipping it midway so both sides are rolled evenly.\nSet a dry non-stick frying pan over medium heat, place a pancake in it and cook until it is puffy and the bottom is flecked with brown, about 2\u20133 minutes. Flip it over and cook the other side for 2\u20133 minutes, then remove. Carefully separate the two layers to give you two pancakes. Keep on a plate, covered with a clean tea towel, while you cook the rest, separating them as well, to give you twelve in total.\nTransfer the jackfruit to a serving platter. To eat, scoop a little bit of jackfruit onto a pancake, top with a drizzle of hoisin sauce and a few slivers of carrot, cucumber and spring onion, then wrap up and enjoy.\n\nPreparing jackfruit\n\nAfter draining your tin of young green jackfruit, rinse it well in a sieve under cold running water \u2013 this helps to get rid of the slightly sweet jackfruit flavour. After rinsing, cut away the tough core of each piece of jackfruit, then shred the remaining flesh into something resembling pulled pork. Discard all the seeds and seed pods.\n\nCredit for the recipe and image: Jackfruit and Blue Ginger by Sasha Gill (Murdoch Books)\n"

Knead a little with your hand until everything is well\u00a0mixed, but don\u2019t knead too long, otherwise you\u2019ll squish the\u00a0onions out of the dough. Cover the bowl with a warm, moist\u00a0towel and let it rest for about 30 minutes.\nHeat more neutral oil in a non-stick frying pan to medium\u00a0heat. Form 9-10 meatballs and place them in the pan. They\u00a0should not be crowded, I fry them in two batches.\nIt\u2019s important not to fry them like you\u2019re frying\u00a0meat: they need to fry slowly on low to medium temperature (I\u00a0use grade 3 of 6) for about 30 minutes. Flip them repeatedly\u00a0after about 8 minutes to let them brown evenly. They stay soft\u00a0for a long time and don\u2019t start to brown till the end. After\u00a0about 30 minutes they should be done, you can take them out\u00a0when they have the desired colour.\nLike most seitan \u2018meats\u2019 they\u2019re best after cooling\u00a0completely. Fresh out of the pan the crust is a little hard,\u00a0it will soften after cooling while the inside gets firmer.\u00a0They\u2019re perfect after a night in the fridge. You can reheat\u00a0them in a pan or in hot gravy.

        "instructions": "\nServes four or two big portions with leftovers for the next day!\nServing suggestions: wilted kale and toasted sunflower seeds, roasted Brussel sprouts, roasted cauliflower and broccoli, steamed broccoli\n\n\nPut the cashews in a bowl with some water and cover with water and leave to soak \u2013 allow for two hours unless you have a mega powerful blender!\nIf using the pepper and roasting your own then rub with a little oil and put on baking tray and into hot oven. Allow for 30 minutes to cook. If using peppers from a jar then you can add later.\nIf serving with roasted veg, prep and put in oven alongside the pepper. Crunchy veg will take longer than the pepper to roast so timing should be about spot on.\nAdd pasta to pot of boiling water and cook as per packet instructions. When al dente pour into colander and rinse with cold water. Set aside.\nWhile the pasta is cooking, finely chop your onions and garlic and add to a big pan with oil. Cook until nicely softened but not brown. If using carrot, also chop finely and add alongside the onions and garlic. Cook until carrot is soft.\nScrape down the pan and add the onion and garlic mix to the blender, along with the rest of the ingredients (don\u2019t add the yeast last or you will lose some of it when it whizzes around). If using the pepper, this is when you add it. (Remove as much of the skin as you can before doing so and exclude all pips and the stalk.)\nYou now need to blend until lovely and smooth. This will take at least three or four goes depending on your blender. Scrape down the sides in between blends to make sure everything is incorporated.\nPour the mixture back into the pot that you cooked the onions and garlic in and allow to thicken on a medium/low heat. Stir frequently.\nWhen thickened you can choose to add the lemon juice. I find that it lifts it a little but taste before doing so. Just add a little squeeze first if you like and then taste again.\nNow add the cold pasta into the sauce, mix thoroughly and heat through.\nWhen nice and hot it\u2019s time to serve\u2026 Spoon into large bowls with accompanying veg.

Whisk together well.\n3) Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients, add the liquid and bring together. You may need to use a spoon or spatula to combine initially but once it forms a dough the best thing to do is just get stuck in with your hands.\n4) Kneed the dough in the bowl for 10 minutes or so until it toughens up and holds its shape. Let it rest for 10 minutes then kneed again for a further 5-10 minutes.\n5) Oil an 8inch x 8inch dish, shape the seitan dough to the dish and bake in the oven for 30 \u2013 40 minutes.\nPreparing the Sauce:\n1) Whilst the seitan is cooking in the oven, you can move on to preparing the sauce. Very simply add all of the ingredients to a small saucepan and heat over medium heat for 10 \u2013 15 minutes until it has reduced, the sugar has melted and thickened the sauce.\nMarinating and Cooking the Seitan:\nThis recipe works best if you can prepare it the day before and leave time for the seitan to marinate in the sauce overnight. However, if you\u2019re pushed for time then marinating for 4 hours or so should suffice.\n1) Once the seitan has cooled, slice into strips and add to a fresh dish large enough to accommodate the marinade.\n2) To marinate, take half of the prepared sauce, add 50ml of water to thin it out and cover the seitan strips. Cover with cling film and pop it in the fridge.\n3) \u00a0To cook the strips, once they have marinated for as long as you have time to allow, add them to a heated frying pan along with the marinade and fry on medium-high for 10 minutes.\n4) Turn the strips over regularly to ensure even cooking and add the remaining half of the sauce. Lower to heat to medium and continue cooking for a further 5 \u2013 10 minutes to heat through the sauce. Be sure to continue turning the strips every few minutes for even cooking.\nThe strips are now ready to use as you wish, whether it be with noodles, fried rice or in a veggie stir fry.\n"

This way of cooking the beans makes sure they all get fried and take on the flavours of the vegetables and coriander.\nOnce all the beans have been mashed add the shoyu or tamari and a little water, until you get the texture that you want. Keep it a bit looser than you eventually want, as they will continue to firm up as they cool off the heat.\nThese will also freeze well, so it\u2019s a good idea to make more than you need.

        "instructions": "\nTo make the most of fruits in season check the helpful guides from Eat Seasonably and What\u2019s in Season. Celebrate fruits at their very best, full of flavour and nutrients and produced in harmony with the environment.\n\n\nTo achieve the best results when making pastry, everything needs to be as cool as possible, including your kitchen. You can even pre-chill your flour and the bowl you\u2019ll be using!\nSieve the flour and sugar into the bowl and add the cubes of vegan margarine. Rub the fat into the flour using your fingertips, working quickly and with a light touch to avoid the fat melting, until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Check for any remaining lumps of margarine by shaking the bowl to bring them to the surface.\nMake a well in the centre of the mixture and add the chilled water, a little at a time. Lightly work the mixture to form a ball, adding a sprinkle of flour if the mixture is too wet, or a touch more water if it\u2019s too dry.\nAllow the pastry to \u2018rest\u2019 in the fridge for 20-30 minutes prior to using it.\nRoll out the pastry on a floured surface, then line a 9\u201d greased flan tin and return to the fridge for a further 30 minutes to chill, as this should help prevent the pastry from shrinking.\nPre-heat the oven to 190\u00baC/375\u00baF/Gas Mark 5.\nBake the pastry case \u2018blind\u2019 (partially baking pastry before adding a wet filling, to avoid making it soggy). Prick over with a fork, line with greaseproof paper and fill with ceramic baking beans, dried pulses or uncooked rice.\nBake for about 15 minutes or until the pastry starts to become a light golden brown. Remove the paper and beans, then return to the oven for a couple of minutes. Remove the pastry case from the oven and allow to cool.\nIn the meantime make the fruit filling. Wash and prepare the fruit by either trimming the rhubarb, stoning the cherries or plums or coring the apples. Reserve the most attractive fruits for decorating the top.\nCut the remainder into small pieces and simmer in a pan over a gentle heat with the margarine, sugar or syrup, a splash of water and the optional lemon juice and cinnamon until soft and pulpy. In the unlikely event that the mixture is far too wet, simply remove any excess juice and thicken the fruit pulp with a little cornflour or tapioca flour. Remove from the heat and allow to cool, then use to cover the base of the pastry case.\nCut the reserved fruit accordingly \u2013 the rhubarb into pieces, the cherries and plums into halves and the apples into slices \u2013 and arrange neatly on top. If necessary, brush the apple slices with a little lemon juice to prevent them from browning. They look great laid in concentric circles, each slice overlapping the last! If you like, you can also brush the fruit with a little melted vegan margarine and sprinkle with cinnamon.\nBake for 25 minutes at 180\u00baC/350\u00baF/Gas Mark 4. If you want to brown the edges of the fruit, just flash the tart under a hot grill.\nFor a really quick and easy glaze, brush the tart over with the warmed, sieved apricot preserve.\nServe the tart warm or at room temperature. For an extra finishing touch, lightly dust with icing sugar and serve with plain soya yogurt which has been strained and flavoured with a little vanilla and cardamom.\nAlternatively, you could indulge in some delicious Booja Booja \u2018icecream\u2019 which is based on cashew nuts and agave nectar. The \u2018Keep Smiling Vanilla M\u2019Gorilla\u2019 would make a great accompaniment, or maybe the \u2018Pompompous Maple Pecan\u2019 or \u2018Coconut Hullabaloo\u2019!\n\n"

Remove with a slotted spoon, place on some kitchen paper to soak up any excess oil and season to taste.\nWhen you\u2019re ready to eat, heat the oil to 190\u02daC/375\u02daF, put the chips back in and cook until they\u2019re golden and crispy. This should take about 6 minutes. Meanwhile, put the peas in boiling water with a little salt, bring to the boil, then cook for a couple of minutes until they\u2019re slightly overdone.

Carefully place each one in the BBQ sauce, coat using a spoon, then place back onto the baking tray.\nCook for a further 10 minutes, arrange on a plate with the ranch and serve!\n\nNOTES:\u00a0Freezing the tofu isn\u2019t essential, but it leads to a chewier texture.

Preheat your grill to maximum.\n\n\nSlice the red onion and put it into the frying pan with a little oil. Tear the mushrooms into pieces and roughly chop the garlic, then add to the pan with the thyme leaves and cook for 4\u20135 minutes, turning every so often, until the mushrooms are charred and crispy and cooked through. Remove and put aside for later.\n\n\nNext, make the cashew ricotta: put all the ingredients into the bowl of a food processor with 3 tablespoons of cold water and blend until completely smooth \u2013 this should take 2\u20135 minutes, depending on how powerful your machine is. It should be the consistency of normal ricotta. Scoop out into a bowl and wash the processor bowl.\n\n\nNow make the dough. Put the four and water into the processor with a good pinch of salt and a tablespoon of olive oil and pulse until the dough comes together in a ball. Tip it out and bring it together in your hands.\n\n\nGet your frying pan on a medium to high heat. If you have two pans about the right size you can do both the pizzas at once, otherwise you can do one after the other, as they cook quickly.\n\n\nCut the dough into two equal halves and cover one half for later.\n\n\nPut the other half on to a floured work surface and use a rolling pin to roll it out into a 1cm thick circle about the size of your frying pan.\n\n\nDrizzle a little oil into the hot pan, then carefully lift in the dough. Leave it on the heat for about 3 minutes, so the base is starting to cook, while you quickly top the pizza.\n\n\nSpoon half the tomato passata over, then the mushrooms. Dot with the cashew cheese and the olives.\n\n\nPop the pizza under the grill for 4\u20135 minutes, until it is cooked through and the cashew cheese is browned.\n\n\nRepeat with the second pizza.\n\n\nTo finish, strew with some rocket leaves and cut into generous slices.\n\n"

        "instructions": "\nEquipment\n\nBowl and water for soaking the almonds\nMeasuring cups\nFood processor\nJam straining bag\nGlass bottle with airtight lid\n\n\nAdd the almonds to a bowl and fully cover with cold water. Soak overnight or for at least 8 hours; you may need to top the water up the next day if you\u2019re not using them immediately, as they soak it up and expand.\n* Time Saving Tip *\nIn a hurry? Pour boiling water over the almonds, soak for two hours and they will soften quick enough to use.\nDrain and rinse until the water runs clear. The nuts will have expanded and you\u2019ll now have almost 3 cups worth, so measure out 1 cup and add to the food processor.\nBlitz for 20 seconds until they\u2019re broken into tiny crumb-like pieces, then pour in 3 cups of chilled water and blitz again for another 30 seconds. Stretch the jam-straining bag over the edges of the bowl, and pour the mixture in.\nAfter two minutes, gently squeeze the outside of the bag to get as much milk out of the pulp as possible. Set the pulp aside and repeat the steps twice more.\n* Time Saving Tip *\nIf you\u2019re making this regularly, using a jam bag stand makes the process easier, this is mine.\nOnce you\u2019ve finished, rinse your straining bag and leave to dry naturally. Look after it this way and it can be reused over and over again.\n* Top Tip *\nYou can use the leftover pulp as almond \u2018flour\u2019 for other recipes like our ginger nut crunch muesli. Simply spread out on a baking tray and \u2018dry out\u2019 for 1 hour in a 125c oven. Once cool, store in an airtight jar.\nPour the milk into glass containers that have airtight lids, I use Kilner bottles. Store in the fridge for up to 5 days; as the milk doesn\u2019t contain emulsifiers, it will naturally separate in the bottle. Simply shake well each time before using and enjoy the goodness of your own homemade almond milk \u2013 it\u2019s\u00a0perfect for breakfast, fresh fruit smoothies, ice lollies, or as an everyday delicious milk substitute!\n"

There should always be some lumps when you remove from the microwave that you stir out. Do not melt the chocolate completely by microwaving.)\n"

When cooled after around half an hour, gently unroll the log and spread with black cherry jam and the buttercream. Once again carefully re-roll the cake this time gently removing the greaseproof paper as you roll. Once rolled place the log on a piece of clingfilm and roll tightly and place in the fridge to chill until needed, you could actually freeze the cake at this stage for half an hour.\n7. To assemble. Slice the swiss roll into 8-10 slices and place inside a medium size glass bowl. Drain the cherries , reserving the juice, and add to the bowl then drizzle over some of the reserved juice.\n8. For the custard. Add the soya milk and vanilla extract into a pan and gently warm. Remove from the heat and add 1-2 tablespoons of the warmed milk into a jug with the Birds custard powder and sugar.

Leave to cool for 10 minutes then pour over the sponge mixture, place in the fridge and leave to set.\n9. For the topping. Remove the lids off the canned coconut and scoop the solid coconut cream into a bowl (you do not want any of the coconut water) then add the icing sugar and whisk until smooth. Pile the cream topping onto the trifle, spread evenly to the outer edges..\n10. Garnish with pistachios and rose petals\nNOTES\n1. You could use ready made custard but this will have a looser set.\n2. An alternative garnish would be with leftover cherries and chocolate shavings.\n"

Place 1 cherry in the opening of the wine bottle and use the sharp end of the chopstick to push out the pit.\n\n\nOnce all the cherries are pitted add them to a saucepan with the 2 tablespoons of sugar and vanilla extract. Cook on a medium-low heat until the juices run out and the fruit is soft. Set aside to cool.\n\n\nDivide the pastry into two equal parts.Flour your surface and roll out one piece of pastry into an 8 inch circle and carefully lay it over the pie dish.\n\n\nUsing your fingers press the pastry into the dish. Cut away the excess pastry. Scoop out the cherries using a slotted spoon, making sure not too take too much of the juice, into the pie casing.\n\n\nRoll out your second piece of dough and carefully lay it over the top of the pie. Using your thumb press all the way around the edge of the dish to seal the pastry. Cut away the excess pastry. Then using your finger, press the thumb sealed part inwards to make a little flute.\n\n\nIf you want to, you can use your excess pastry to make a little decoration! Cut two slits in the top of the pie crust then brush it with a little aquafaba.\n\n\nBake the pie in the oven for 25 minutes or until golden brown, rotating half way.\n\n"

Stir occasionally to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan.\n* Top Tip *\nKeep an eye on the pan as the timings are just a guide \u2013 don\u2019t over simmer the relish or it will dry up and burn.\nThe relish is ready when the excess liquid has been absorbed but it\u2019s still moist \u2013 taste and adjust any seasonings or sweetness to your own taste. Leave to cool and store in an airtight jar.\n* Serving Suggestion *\nThis sweet chilli relish is delicious on crackers, open sandwiches and serves as a great party dip for slices of toasted pitta bread. It\u2019s also perfect for mixing through cooked pasta and veggies to add a spicy twist, plus any other tasty combinations you discover! Store it in the fridge and it will keep for up to 1 week (if you haven\u2019t eaten it all by then!)\nI\u2019ve got loads more yummy vegan recipes on\u00a0LottieLovesFood.com\u00a0or come say hi on\u00a0twitter\u00a0or\u00a0instagram.\n"

        "instructions": "\nServes 4\n\n\nHeat the oven to 180C. Wash the beetroots, brush with a little oil and wrap each one in foil. Wrap the garlic cloves into a loose foil parcel and place beets and garlic into the centre of the oven for 45 minutes.\nDry fry the cumin seeds in a non-stick frying pan for a minute or two keeping them moving so they don\u2019t burn. Using a pestle and mortar or spice grinder grind the toasted seeds and set aside.\nReserving the liquid, drain and mash the butterbeans and add in tahini, if using. I mash the beans quite coarsely so as to keep a chunky texture but if you prefer a smoother consistency you might want to use a blender. Once mashed stir in the cumin, lemon juice and season well.\nPeel the beetroot and garlic. Cut the beetroot into quarters and place in a blender. Cut the very tips of the garlic cloves and squeeze the soft garlic pulp in with the beetroot. Add a tablespoon of the reserved liquid from the beans and pulse. If the beetroot needs a bit of encouragement to move then add more of the reserved liquid as necessary. Blend until you have a smooth pur\u00e9e. Season to taste.\nCoarsely chop the mint leaves and grind in a pestle and mortar with the oil. If you don\u2019t want to use oil then finely chop the leaves and scatter on at the end.\nTo serve, dollop the bean mixture into a bowl or plate and create a shallow well in the centre. Spoon the beetroot pur\u00e9e into the well and drizzle the mint and oil over the top.\n\n"

Let the mixture cool for about half an hour before transferring the glasses to your fridge.\nRefrigerate the panna cottas for at least 4 hours, until set.\u00a0Once the panna cottas are cooling you can get to work on the compote.\nAdd the fresh raspberries, lemon juice, water and sugar to a medium saucepan. Crush up the raspberries a little in the pan with a spoon. Bring this mixture to a boil and allow it to keep boiling for a couple of minutes, stirring occasionally.\nThen, turn the heat right down. Leave the pan uncovered, on a very low simmer, until most of the water has evaporated and the fruit has cooked down into a nice, smooth compote-y paste. Keep stirring the mixture every 10 minutes or so to help break the raspberries down.\nIf you\u2019re not a fan of raspberry seeds, sieve your compote before cooling it. Otherwise, simply set it aside for 40-50 minutes, or until your panna cottas are set.\nWhen the compote is cool and your \u2018cottas set, scoop on top of each one an even amount of raspberry compote. Serve, preferably as soon as possible, and at most within 2-3 hours of assembling.\n\n"

        "instructions": "\nTo make the pastry, sieve the flour into a large bowl and rub in the cubes of vegan margarine with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Work quickly and with a light touch to avoid the fat melting. Check for any remaining lumps of margarine by shaking the bowl to bring them to the surface.\nMake a well in the centre of the mixture and add some chilled water, a little at a time. Lightly work the mixture to form a ball, adding a sprinkle of flour if the mixture is too wet, or a touch more water if it\u2019s too dry. Cover and chill for 20-30 minutes.\nGrease a 9\u201d fluted flan tin, preferably with a removable base. Roll the pastry out thinly on a lightly floured surface and line the tin. For an extra finishing touch, you can crimp the edge with your thumb. Prick over the pastry case with a fork, to prevent the base puffing up during baking. Cover and return to the fridge while you prepare the filling.\nMeanwhile, preheat the oven to 200\u00baC/400\u00baF/Gas Mark 6 and put in a heavy baking tray to heat through. Baking the pie on a hot baking sheet will ensure a crisp base to the pastry case.\nTo make the filling, gently warm the syrup over a low heat, making sure it doesn\u2019t boil. Stir in the brown sugar and vanilla extract.\nRemove from the heat and add the breadcrumbs and chopped pecans. Add a few more breadcrumbs if the mixture seems a bit runny.\nPour the mixture into the pastry case and level the surface. Decorate the top with the whole pecan nuts, placing them in concentric circles.\nBake the pie on the preheated baking tray for about 10 minutes until the pastry has started to colour, then reduce the oven temperature to 180\u00baC/350\u00baF/Gas Mark 4. If the pecans appear to be getting too dark brown, cover the pie with foil.\nContinue baking for a further 25-30 minutes until the pastry is golden and the filling is lightly firm and set. The top should be chewy and the middle soft and moist, with the pecans nice and crunchy.\nRemove from the oven and leave in the tin to cool a little and firm up. Serve your pie warm or cold. You could add a dash of maple syrup to your favourite vegan cream or ice cream alternative to accompany this wonderfully gooey treat.\n\u00a0\nLike this recipe?

Using a food processor or stick blender, blitz the spring onions, green chilli, coriander stalks, garlic, ginger, turmeric and cumin and coriander seeds with half the can of coconut milk until a rough paste forms.\n3. Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil, lower in the potatoes and boil or 15 minutes or until a sharp knife passes through them easily. Drain and set aside.\n4. Place the cauliflower in a deep roasting tin and pour the remaining coconut milk around it. Scatter the kaffir lime leaves over the coconut milk. Rub 1 tablespoon of the coconut oil over the cauliflower and season well with salt and pepper. Then use a spatula or spoon to rub the spice paste all over the cauliflower, getting into every crevice of each floret. Squeeze the lime juice over the cauliflower. Cover the tin tightly with foil, place on the middle shelf of the oven and roast the cauliflower for 20 minutes.\n5. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons coconut oil in a separate shallow roasting tin on the top shelf of the oven above the cauliflower for a couple of minutes. Carefully remove the tin from the oven, arrange the potatoes in a single even layer in the hot oil and use a potato masher to press down on them just to split their skins. Scatter the mustard and coriander seeds over the top, season well with salt and pepper and roast on the top shelf for 45 minutes until the potatoes are crispy and golden all over.\n6. Once the cauliflower has roasted for 20 minutes, lift the foil away and baste the top with the bubbling, spiced coconut milk from the tin. Roast, uncovered, for a further 25\u201330 minutes until the top of the cauliflower is crispy and charring.\n7. When the roasted potatoes are done, remove the tin from the oven, scatter the kale and chopped red chillies over the potatoes and stir to coat in the flavoured oil. Roast for 5 minutes until the kale is just starting to wilt but is still bright green.\n8. Lift the kale and potatoes out of the tin with a slotted spoon and arrange on a large platter. Place the cauliflower in the centre of the platter and spoon over any bright yellow liquid from the tin. Scatter over the reserved coriander leaves. At the table, use a serrated knife to slice the cauliflower into bold wedges and, if you want extra heat, garnish with the slivers of bright red chilli.\n"

        "instructions": "\nServes 4-6 |\u00a0Dietary: Vegan, Wheat Free (without the croutons)\n\nSoup:\n\nPre heat the oven to 200c/ gas mark 6.\nPeel the celeriac using a sharp peeler and remove any areas where the roots are still visible.\nChop into 1 cm cubes and place in a roasting tin with a splash of rapeseed or vegetable oil.\nRoast the celeriac for 25 minutes or until it is softened and golden around the edges. Add the caraway seeds and return to the oven for another five minutes.\nWhile the celeriac is roasting heat a little oil in a large sauce pan and gently cook the onion, until it is really soft and starting to caramelise. Add the garlic and fry for another 5 minutes.\nAdd the roasted celeriac, bouquet garni\u00a0and caraway to the onion mixture and stir well.\nPour on the stock and soya milk and simmer for 5 minutes.\nRemove the bouquet garni and blend until smooth with a hand blender. Taste, season and serve\n\nTip: A bouquet garni is a small bunch of herbs that you add to soups and stews to infuse the dish with flavour-it is removed before serving. Traditionally the herbs are \u201chard herbs\u201d such as bay, rosemary, sage, thyme, all of which grow well in the British winter. You can tie them together with clean string (you can buy cooking string from kitchen shops) or use a heatproof plastic freezer clip-one that has been washed in a hot dishwasher or placed in boiling water before use to sterilise.\nCroutons:\n\nPreheat the oven to 200c/ gas mark 6\nHeat a roasting dish in the oven. Add the oil and then the bread and mix well.\nCook in the oven for approximately 10 minutes and then add the chopped garlic and stir in. Return to the oven and roast for another 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally so that the bread is crispy and golden.\nFinely chop the herbs and capers together with the lemon zest.\nAdd the chopped herbs to the crispy croutons and mix together. Taste and add pepper (you probably won\u2019t need salt as the capers are salty already)\nUse to garnish the soup-any leftovers can be stored in an airtight box in the fridge and will keep for about 3 days.\n\nTips: These croutons are a great way of using up stale bread-they are traditionally made with sourdough or ciabatta style bread. You can also use a wheat free or spelt bread. Croutons on their own (without added herbs) will keep for weeks in a sealed container out of the fridge-once you add fresh herbs they won\u2019t last so long and need to be kept cold. If you like things spicy add some flaked chilli to the croutons. Croutons don\u2019t need to be just for soup-they are also great added to pasta dishes, rice or salads. Vary the herbs that you use \u2013 parsley is ideal but basil, chives, dill, sorrel and coriander would also work.\n"

Whisk well to combine and place over a low heat.\nPlace the remaining 50ml of plant milk in a small bowl and add the cornstarch and turmeric powder. Whisk well until smooth and no lumps remain.\nGradually whisk the cornstarch mixture into the warmed plant milk. Keep whisking constantly over low heat until the mixture thickens dramatically. Once thickened, leave the mixture to bubble a couple of times before removing from the heat and vigorously whisking in the vegan butter.\nPour the custard into a baking tray (this will allow it to cool more quickly) and cover with cling film, making sure the film is making contact with the surface of the custard.\nOnce cooled to room temperature, refrigerate the custard for a minimum of 20 minutes.\n\nTo Peel the Peaches\n\nIf using fresh peaches rather than canned, fill a large bowl with ice cold water.\nPlace a medium saucepan over medium heat and bring to the boil. Once boiling, remove the pan from the heat and carefully drop the peaches into the water. Leave them there for maximum three mins or until the skins start to split.\nUse a slotted spoon to remove the peaches from the hot water and put them straight into the cold water to stop them from cooking.\nThe skin should slip off easily, but if not, you may need to use a vegetable peeler to start the process.\nOnce peeled, halve the peaches and remove the stones. Set aside.\n\nTo Make the Pastries\n\nPreheat the oven to 200c fan.\nRemove the pastry from the fridge and carefully unroll onto a baking tray lined with parchment (if the end of the pastry is a little still and doesn\u2019t want to unroll, leave it to warm up for 2 minutes).\nRemove the custard from the fridge and transfer it to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on high speed until smooth again. If you don\u2019t have a stand mixer, beat with a whisk until smooth.\nDivide the dough into 6 squares using a pizza cutter (for me each square was 12.5cm).\nIn a cup, mix together the plant milk, oil, and syrup. This will be your \u201cegg wash\u201d.\nUsing a pastry brush, apply a small amount of egg wash to the centre of each square.\nFold the corners of the square into the centre and push them down gently to stick.\nAdd a heaped tablespoon of custard to the centre of each pastry square. Follow with a peach half and push down gently to make sure the custard squeezes out further than the peach half.\nBrush the pastry with the egg wash and place in the oven for 15-20 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown.\n\nTo Finish\n\nWhisk together the icing sugar and plant milk until smooth and thick enough to drizzle off the whisk.\nDrizzle the icing over the pastries.\nSprinkle the pistachios over the pastries before serving.\n\n"

For this recipe, I formed the patties the night before and then froze them in order to make them grillable. This actually worked really well. Note, however, that I grilled them in a grill pan, not on an outdoor grill. Your results may vary.\n\n\nTo make the patties, combine one half of the beans and one half of the rice in a food processor. Add the oil and salsa and process until mostly smooth. Combine with the remaining ingredients in a large bowl and mix well. Form into 8 patties with your hands. I roughly measured them as 1/3 cup of patty mix each. Wrap in waxed paper or parchment paper and let freeze in a container or on a flat surface in a plastic bag.\nTo make the bitty burger buns, combine the warm water, agave, and yeast and whisk until combined, just a few seconds. Let stand 10 minutes until proofed. Combine with the remaining ingredients and mix until dough forms. Knead until smooth. Add more flour if too sticky. I added an additional two tablespoons. I also used my standing mixer for this, using the dough hook of course. I let the machine knead the dough for 3-4 minutes. If kneading by hand you may be looking at 5-7 minutes instead. Roll to a 1/2 inch thickness, then cut with a biscuit cutter into 12-16 rounds.\nSprinkle cornmeal on a couple of cookie sheets. Place the buns on the cookie sheets. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place for one hour. Bake at 375 degrees for 10-12 minutes, until browned on top.\nWhen ready for the burgers, lightly oil a non-stick grill pan. Preheat over medium high heat. Cook each patty for 5-7 minutes, pushing down with a spatula occasionally for nice grill marks. Gently flip and cook for the same amount of time on the other side.\nYou don\u2019t have to make all of the patties at once. Just keep them in the refrigerator until you\u2019re ready for another!\nGarnish with lettuce, tomato, onion, avocado, pickles, you name it.\nMakes 8 patties, 12-16 buns.\n\n\u00a0\n"

Only cut the outer flesh of the cucumber discarding the more watery core.\nHalve and peel the avocado, remove the stone and slice lengthways in half inch slices. Slice the radishes lengthways.\nFill a bowl with slightly warm water. The diameter of the bowl needs to be wider than the rice paper so that the rice paper can be fully immersed in the water.\nDunk one rice paper in the bowl of water for 5 seconds. Give it a shake to get rid of excess water and lay on a clean chopping board.\nNear one of the edges of the paper place a handful or two of the watercress tearing any larger clumps into smaller sections as the rolls are meant to be eaten by hand.\nNext, place two or three slices of the avocado on top of the watercress. Then, take a few sprigs of dill and, using a pair of scissors, chop finely over the avocado and watercress and season with salt and pepper.\nFold the near edge the wrapper over the contents, then fold both sides into the middle and roll up.\nServe with the dipping sauce.\n\n\u00a0\n"

Works perfectly every time. I buy the Biona black rice, but you should be able to find it in most supermarkets.\nRefried Beans \u2013 I\u2019ve been a refried bean fan ever since I was a kid. Great in nachos as well, but lovely here because of their creamy flavour. You buy it in cans, and you\u2019ll find them in the Mexican section.\nGuacamole \u2013 I always make my own, as it is so much tastier, really easy and doesn\u2019t have any sour cream sneaked in (many store-made guacs do, so always check the label before you buy). My \u2018go-to\u2019 recipe is this:\n\nMash up 2 ripe avocados with a fork\nFinely dice some red onion (about half a small one) and a stalk of spring onion \u2013 add to bowl\nFinely dice one red chilli (up to you if you keep the seeds or not!) \u2013 add to bowl\nChop up about 6-8 cherry tomatoes into little pieces (in half and then in half again at least) \u2013 add to bowl\nSqueeze in the juice of about half a lemon \u2013 do this to taste. You can always add more lemon, so start off with a little first\nSalt and cracked pepper\n\nIf you don\u2019t have any fresh chilli then you can use a hot sauce, like Tabasco, instead. And if you\u2019re not keen on heat, then just leave the chilli out altogether.\nChilli Non Carne \u2013 Full recipe here\n\u00a0\n"

Shaking\u00a0them in a\u00a0colander or rolling between sheets of kitchen paper seems to help loosen the skins.\nEither place all of the ingredients in a bowl and mix them together until the chickpeas are nicely coated, or make a little bag with parchment paper to shake it all together (making sure you\u2019ve gathered all the edges together!). My preferred method is to use the parchment paper, as it means you\u2019re not left with an oily bowl to wash up.\nSpread the chickpeas out on a sheet of parchment paper on a baking tray. I use the same sheet of paper from step 3. 5. Cook for 20 minutes, give them a little shake, then cook for a further 20 minutes.\n\n"

        "instructions": "\nI\u2019ve played around with a lot of recipes before settling on this one, some full of bright herb freshness and grated veg, some packed with protein-rich tofu, and all were good, but what I look for in a burger is a deep moreish favour, savoury and complex, so this is the one.\nI use brown rice here, but any cooked grain you have will do \u2013 quinoa, pearl barley and farro all work well.\nI like to make a quick pickled cucumber to top these with. Thinly slice a quarter of a cucumber and pop it into a bowl with a pinch of salt, a squeeze of agave syrup, and a good tablespoon of white wine vinegar, then scrunch together and leave to sit while you make your burgers. A homemade quick pickle that beats a gherkin any day. \ud83d\ude42\n\u00a0\nLike this recipe? Sign up to Veganuary today to get recipes like this delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nGet a large pan on a medium heat and add a splash of olive oil. Once the pan is good and hot, add the mushrooms and thyme and season with salt and pepper. Fry on a good heat until the mushrooms have dried out and are slightly browned, then set to one side and leave to cool.\nNext, drain the white beans and put them into a food processor with the dates, garlic, parsley, tahini and soy sauce. Pulse until you have a smoothish mixture, then transfer to a bowl and add the rice, breadcrumbs, lemon zest and the cooled mushrooms. Mix well, then put into the fridge for 10 minutes or so to firm up.\nOnce cooled, divide the mixture into 8 portions and shape into 8 patties.\u00a0 Place them on a baking tray lined with baking paper and pop into the fridge until needed. (This can be done the day before \u2013 and the burgers freeze well at this point.)\nPreheat your oven to 230\u00b0C/fan 210\u00b0C/gas 8 and bake the burgers for 15 minutes, until nicely brown. If you like cheese on your burger, pop a slice on top a couple of minutes before they come out of the oven.\nWhile your burgers are cooking, get your toppings ready. I go with avocado, tomato relish and the quick cucumber pickle above, plus a few spinach leaves. Hummus, grated carrot and sprouts is another favourite, but feel free to improvise and try it your own way.\nOnce the burgers are golden, toast your buns and layer up your burgers. I like to serve them with the sweet potato fries. You can\u2019t beat a burger and chips, and these ones are as healthy as they are tasty.\n"

(Massaging kale seems hilarious at first, but it does help it to soften, and basically you\u2019re just rubbing it between your fingers. When I first started eating raw kale I found it quite tough, so the more you massage it then softer it gets. If the kale is very fresh you may hardly need to do this. It really is a case of personal taste. I don\u2019t notice the toughness of kale in the same way I used to, because I eat it such a lot.) Rip the kale and lettuce into smaller pieces, and discard any woody kale stalks\nChop up your peppers, celery, cucumber, gherkins, olives and chuck in a big bowl\nAdd the puy lentils and marinated tofu and mix well\nAdd the lettuce and kale bit by bit, mixing as you go. A good salad is one where you get a bit of everything, so try to evenly distribute\nAdd the sunflower seeds, a good splash of olive oil and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar\nCrack pepper over the top and a little salt if you think it needs it\nServe in big bowls and enjoy!\n\nAdditions:\u00a0Crusty bread, hummus, more olives, guacamole, aubergine dip or\u00a0a tomato, red onion and basil salad all go well with this. Create a table of colour with the salad as the centre piece! Also perfect picnic grub on a lovely summer day. This is a filling salad though, and delicious just as it is.\n"

Refrigerate until very cold before cutting into squares.\n\nKeeping:\u00a0Refrigerate the brownies in a covered container, in layers separated by parchment, for up to three days, or freeze for up to one month. Defrost unwrapped or eat straight out of the freezer.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"

        "title": "Coconut Bacon",
        "ingredients": "\n\n2 tablespoons liquid smoke (hickory or mesquite flavor)\n2 tablespoons tamari soy sauce\n1 tablespoon maple syrup or agave nectar\n1 tablespoon water\n3\u00bd cups (200 g) unsweetened coconut flakes\n\n",
        "instructions": "\nMakes 3\u00bd cups\n\nPreheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nIn a large bowl, stir together the liquid smoke, tamari soy sauce, maple syrup or agave nectar, and water.\nAdd the coconut flakes to the bowl, and using a rubber spatula, gently toss together the coconut with the liquid mixture until the coconut flakes are thoroughly coated.\nTransfer the coated coconut flakes onto the prepared baking sheet, spreading them out in a single layer so they cook evenly, and place the baking sheet in the preheated oven. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, and stay close by.\nAfter 10 or 15 minutes and every 5 minutes thereafter, you will want to toss and flip the flakes using a spatula. This is not only to make sure the flakes cook evenly but also to ensure that they don\u2019t burn, and they will burn if you don\u2019t regularly toss them.\nDepending on your oven, you may also need to turn the baking sheet around to ensure they cook up evenly. As you continue to check, feel free to taste to make sure they\u2019re nice and crispy. They will be a nice brown color when they\u2019re done, and if you test them, you\u2019ll notice the coconut flavor is pretty much gone.\nRemove from the oven, and let cool before storing in a sealed bag or container. (They continue to crisp up as they cool.) The coconut bacon will stay fresh for up to 3 weeks\u2014in or out of the refrigerator.\nSuggestions for Serving\n\nMake a classic Bacon, Lettuce, and Tomato Sandwich with some avocado slices!\nTop a baked potato with a couple tablespoons, as you would with bacon bits.\nOffer the coconut bacon as an option for a salad topping.\nIt\u2019s a great garnish for soup.\nSprinkle them on top of your favorite Macaroni & Cheese recipe or on top of pasta.\n\nFor Your Information\nLook for unsweetened coconut flakes in the bulk section of your grocery store; packaged brands include Edward & Sons/Let\u2019s Do Organic and Bob\u2019s Red Mill (USA only).\nFor Your Edification\nLiquid smoke adds a wonderful depth of flavor to so many dishes, and a little goes a long way. It\u2019s a great staple to keep in the cupboard, and you\u2019ll find yourself using it often to add a smoky flavor to your favorite recipes.\n"

The remaining \u2154 will be used for the \u201cyolk\u201d filling.\nTo prepare the \u201cegg whites\u201d, place the \u201cegg white\u201d ingredients into a blender and process until smooth. Pour the mixture into a saucepan and bring to rapid simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently to avoid scorching the tofu mixture. Pour the mixture into the 8\u201d baking pan and set aside to cool. If you have chocolate egg molds, or a heat-proof container that specifically holds deviled eggs, pour the tofu mixture directly into the molds and set aside to cool.\nNext, crumble the \u2154 block of pressed tofu into the food processor and add the remaining \u201cyolk\u201d filling ingredients. Process the contents until completely smooth, stopping as necessary to scrape down the sides of the food processor. Alternately, the mixture can be mashed using a fork or a potato masher/ricer, but the mixture will not be as smooth.\nTransfer the \u201cyolk\u201d mixture to a bowl or food storage container, season with additional kala namak if desired, cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Cover the baking pan with plastic wrap or foil and refrigerate until the \u201cegg whites\u201d have completely set, or a minimum of 30 minutes.\nNow, run a table knife around the perimeter of the baking pan to loosen the \u201cegg white\u201d (or simply pop them out of the chocolate egg molds). Invert the baking pan onto a clean work surface. At this point, the \u201cegg white\u201d can be cut into rectangles or cut into rounds or ovals.\nFor rectangles, cut the \u201cegg whites\u201d into 6 even strips. Turn your cutting surface and make 4 even slices. This will create 24 rectangles. For rounds or ovals, use a 1 and \u00bd-inch to 1 and \u00be-inch cookie cutter or ring mold. Any \u201cegg white\u201d remnants can be finely diced and mixed with any of the leftover \u201cyolk\u201d filling for a quick eggless egg salad sandwich.\nSpoon a generous teaspoonful of the \u201cyolk\u201d mixture onto the top of each \u201cegg white\u201d. Alternately, the mixture can be decoratively piped onto the \u201cegg whites\u201d using a pastry bag. If you don\u2019t have a pastry bag, try placing the mixture into a zip-lock bag, seal and then snip off a tiny piece from the bottom corner of the bag with scissors. Squeeze the bag to pipe the mixture onto the \u201cegg whites\u201d.\nSprinkle with paprika and garnish with optional ingredients as desired. Cover gently with plastic wrap and chill thoroughly before serving.\n"

        "instructions": "\n\nAdd all the dry ingredients to a large bowl and mix well with a fork before making a well in the centre.\n\n\nAdd the cider vinegar, soya sauce, liquid smoke, tomato paste, and a little of the stock. Different brands of wheat gluten need different amounts of stock so be cautious at first. You can always add but you can\u2019t take away.\n\n\nMix well with a wooden spoon, adding a little stock as you go until it comes together. You want it to be moist but it requires kneading too so it can\u2019t be too wet. If you add too much stock, you can always add more wheat gluten.\n\n\nOnce it has all come together, knead the dough for 5 minutes. You should start to see some stringy bits forming. That is the gluten developing.\n\n\nOnce you have done that, divide out the dough in to equal portions. This should make 4 but you can do more or less, depending on how big you want them to be.\n\n\nRoll each piece in to a rough sausage shape and then wrap in tin foil and fold or twist the ends shut. I usually lightly oil the tin foil, just in case they stick. Make sure you go around the sausage a couple of times otherwise they can burst. You don\u2019t have to do it too tightly, the sausage will expand to fill the space.\n\n\nOnce you have them all rolled up, put them in a steamer for 45 mins. If you made lots of thin sausages, 35 \u2013 40 mins should be fine. If you made really large sausages then you want to be more like 55 \u2013 60 mins. I turned mine over halfway through the steaming as well.\n\n\nOnce they have steamed, let them cool without opening the packages. Put them in the fridge where they will become more solid over a few hours. They last a week or two in the fridge if you don\u2019t open them.\n\nLike this recipe?

Note: If you are using the oven at the same time, roast the garlic first to really bring out the flavour (it\u2019s not essential at all, but it does add a bit of culinary magic if you can).\nSimmer for 20 minutes or until you can easily pierce the cauliflower with a fork.

        "instructions": "\n1. Preheat the oven to 180c fan. Grease and line a baking tray (roughly 33 x 25cm) with parchment paper.\n2. Pour the aquafaba and the cream of tartar into the bowl of a stand mixer and mix on medium high speed until stiff peaks are formed. This means the aquafaba doesn\u2019t move even when tipped upside down.\n3. Meanwhile, place the plant milk into the microwave for 1 minute to warm through, this can also be done in a pan over a medium heat on the hob. Add in the apple cider vinegar and stir, place to the side.\n4. In a large mixing bowl, add the plain flour, caster sugar, cocoa powder, salt, baking powder and baking soda. Mix with a whisk until fully combined.\n5. Add the oil and the milk/apple cider vinegar mixture to the dry ingredients and mix until fully combined. The mixture will be very stiff and dry at this point but that\u2019s normal.\n6. Gently fold the aquafaba into the mixture one spoon at a time, trying not to knock too much air out. It will become a much looser mixture as you add more aquafaba.\n7. Pour the mixture into the lined baking tray, and level out the top until smooth.\n8. Place in the oven for 12-15mins, until a skewer comes out clean. Whilst the sponge is baking, lay out a piece of parchment paper the size of the sponge and cover with a light sprinkle of caster sugar.\n9. Once the sponge is fully baked, tip it out top side down onto the parchment covered in sugar. Peel off the parchment paper on the bottom of the sponge.\n10. Use a sharp knife to make an incision an inch into the short side of the sponge, being carefully to only cut half way into the sponge and not the full way through (this just makes it easier to roll).\n11. Carefully roll up the sponge with the parchment still inside (this stops it from sticking together) and leave to cool rolled up.\n12. Meanwhile, for the filling, warm the cream until it is steaming (either 1-2minutes in the microwave or over a medium heat on the hob). Once the cream is steaming hot, break up your Rhythm 108 hazelnut truffle bar into chunks and place into the cream. Leave to stand for 1 minute, then stir until a glossy mixture is formed, with no lumps of chocolate.\n13. Place this in the fridge to set. Once the ganache has hardened, place into a large mixing bowl, or the bowl of a stand mixer and whip up on medium high until you get a light and fluffy filling.\n14. Once the sponge is cool, unroll carefully, then fill with the whipped ganache, spreading out evenly over the sponge.\n15. Gently roll back up to form your perfect swiss roll! Don\u2019t panic if there are a few cracks\u2026it looks just as perfect. You can finish by cutting off the edges and dusting lightly with icing sugar!\n"

Melt it in a double boiler by placing a bowl over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bowl doesn\u2019t touch the water.\nMeanwhile, pour the coconut milk into a large bowl and whisk well until smooth or use a blender. If you\u2019re using a 400ml can, whisk or blend the coconut milk before measuring out your 200ml. Stir in the agave nectar and desiccated coconut, then whisk in the melted coconut cream.\nPut the topping in the fridge to set a little until it becomes stiff enough to spread on top of the cooled cake.\nDecorate with slices of firm banana, which have been brushed with lemon juice to prevent them browning, and toasted coconut shreds or chopped nuts.\nKeep refrigerated \u2013 if it\u2019s not gobbled up straight away!\n\n"

Finally, stir in the chopped chocolate.\n\n\nGrease a deep tin or oven-proof dish (glass or ceramic are fine) and pour the mixture in, spreading evenly. Place in the oven and bake for around 45 minutes; the exact cooking time will depend on your oven. For fudgy brownies, you can tell they are cooked when the edges begin to pull away from the container and putting a cocktail stick in doesn\u2019t bring out any lumps (it won\u2019t come out clean for fudgy ones even when they are cooked).\n\n\nOnce the brownies are cooked, remove from the oven. Leave for around five minutes to cool slightly before transferring to a cooling rack or kitchen paper. Allow them to cool completely before adding the topping.\n\n\nWhilst the brownies are cooling, bring a small amount of water to the boil in a large pan. Place a large heat-proof mixing bowl over the pan and add the chocolate, coconut oil, and beetroot water into the bowl. Stir constantly until the ingredients have melted and formed a smooth, glossy paste. Mix in the stevia syrup, if using.\n\n\nSpread the topping evenly over each brownie and sprinkle with either desiccated coconut or grated chocolate.

However, I find there\u2019s plenty of time around Christmas to spend a few hours in the kitchen and these recipes will make enough to keep you and your family going over the festive period.\nThe flax seed crackers recipe makes about 30 crackers, 15 plain and 15 flavoured. I used cavolo nero but you can use any leafy greens or even sun-dried tomatoes, or whatever you fancy to flavour them.\n\nCashew Nut Cheese\n\nPlace the cashews in a glass bowl and cover with water, leave them to soak for at least 2 hours or leave them overnight.\nDrain the cashews, blend them with 250ml water, the nutritional yeast, salt and lemon juice.

Roughly chop the mushrooms and add them to the pan, cooking them for 10-15 minutes until all the liquid has evaporated.\nStir in the crushed peppercorns, salt, herbs and mushroom ketchup. Cook for another few minutes until the ketchup has reduced down, then set aside to cool.\nOnce the chestnuts are roasted, take them out of the oven and leave them to cool before shelling them.\nPut the chestnuts into a blender and blitz until roughly chopped. Add the cooled mushroom mixture, tofu, nutritional yeast and lemon juice. Blend to a fairly smooth paste.\nSpoon the mixture into a springform tin or lined loaf tin and press down firmly. Chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.\n\nFlax Seed Crackers\n\nGrind half the flax seeds with the sunflower seeds in a blender or spice grinder.\nMix together the ground seeds with the whole flax seeds, salt and water.\nPut half this mixture into a blender with the cavolo nero.\nLine two baking trays with baking paper and spoon out the two mixtures on the trays and press down firmly with the back of a spoon.\nScore the mixture into small squares and bake at 170C for 30 mins or until the begin to crisp slightly and aren\u2019t too chewy inside. (If you have a dehydrator, even better!)\nLift the baking paper and crackers out of the trays and place on a wire rack, serve once cooled.\n\n"

The longer you leave them in the better: e.g. you could soak them in the morning and then cook the vegan fish fingers in the evening for a more intense taste. Alternatively, if you don\u2019t have much time heat them up a bit for 5 minutes so they give up more flavour. Make sure the heat isn\u2019t too high because they burn easily.\nStep 2:\nPlace ingredients of step 2 into a food processor until you get a semi-smooth mixture.\nStep 3:\nTransfer the mixture into a large bowl and add all other ingredients from this step and mix. Make sure there are no chickpea flour lumps, otherwise the fish fingers might taste bitter.\nForm fish finger shapes. Alternatively, just form sausage shapes. Admittedly it was a bit of work to make rectangular shapes and when they were fried they lost their shape a bit anyway. So if you want to make your life easier, roll them into a sausage shape, it won\u2019t make a difference in terms of taste. They will be quite soft at this stage, but don\u2019 worry they will firm up when fried.\nStep 4:\nAdd breadcrumbs to a bowl and roll the vegan fish fingers in them until they are covered on all sides.\nTake the sushi sheets out of the pan with cooking oil and heat up the pan. Fry the fish fingers in the pan until they are golden brown. Place on a kitchen towel to soak up the excess oil.\nOptionally drizzle some lemon juice on top when serving the fish fingers.

Cover a baking tray with baking paper, put the orange slices on the paper with the nuts. Bake for 45-60 minutes until the orange has dried out and the nuts are toasted. Finely chop the nuts.\nTo make the frosting drain the cashew nuts, blend the cashew nuts with the plant milk, agave and 1/2tsp vanilla essence until completely smooth. The frosting needs to be completely smooth so that it is thick and will not slide off the cake.\nSpoon the frosting onto the cake. Dress the cake with the orange slices, nuts and cherries.\n"

        "instructions": "\nCombining quintessential autumnal flavors\u2014sage, maple syrup, cinnamon\u2014with an array of multi-colored root vegetables, this perfect fall entr\u00e9e is sophisticated comfort food at its finest. While the combination of root vegetables produces an aesthetically striking dish, it does complicate the process a bit. If you\u2019d like to make the recipe simpler, simply use one root vegetable instead of all six.\n\nPreheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.\nWrap the beets, sweet potato, celeriac, parsnip, and turnip each individually in aluminum foil and place on a baking sheet. Place the butternut squash, face-down, on the baking sheet, as well. Roast all of the veggies for 45-60 minutes until you can pierce through them with a fork. Remove from the oven and let sit until cool enough to handle.\nMeanwhile, make the pesto. Heat the coconut oil over medium-high heat. When the oil shimmers, add the shallots and sage. Saut\u00e9 for 5-10 minutes, or until golden brown. Add the saut\u00e9 to a food processor along with the rest of the pesto ingredients, except for the olive oil. Pulse until well combined, scraping down the sides as necessary. As the motor is running, drizzle in olive oil to achieve the desired consistency.\nSet a large pot of salted water to boil.\nOnce the veggies have cooled, puree each of them separately in a food processor\u00a0(or mash them separately with a potato masher) and place the purees into separate bowls. Make sure that you process the beets last so as not to stain the other veggie purees with a magenta hue. Combine the purees of celeriac, turnip, and parsnip. You\u2019ll have four bowls of puree in front of you: one deep orange\u00a0(butternut squash), one light orange\u00a0(sweet potato), one magenta\u00a0(beet), and one white\u00a0(celeriac, turnip, and parsnip). Combine each of the purees with 1 cup of brown rice flour, adding more to each bowl to achieve an ever-so-slightly sticky consistency\u00a0(the butternut squash and sweet potato purees will require less than the others).\nDust a work surface with additional flour. Divide each dough into two portions and roll them into snakes about 1/2-inch in width. Cut each snake into 10-20 gnocchi and place in a single layer on a baking sheet.\nOnce the pot of water is boiling, drop the gnocchi\u2014ten at a time and only with gnocchi of like color\u2014into the pot. Cook until the gnocchi floats to the top, about 30 seconds. Remove the gnocchi from the water and place in a colander sitting over a bowl to allow the water to drain.\nCombine all of the gnocchi in a large bowl\u00a0(at this point, the boiling will have sealed their color, so it\u2019s safe to combine them). Add the pesto and stir well to coat. Serve warm.\n"

Leave to cool for around 5 minutes and then carefully roll into a swiss roll shape, keeping the greaseproof paper on. When cooled after around half an hour, gently unroll the log and spread with black cherry jam followed by half of the buttercream. Once again carefully re-roll the cake this time carefully removing the greaseproof paper as you roll. Once rolled, place the log on a piece of clingfilm and roll tightly and place in the fridge to chill until needed, you could actually freeze the cake at this stage for half an hour.\n7. To assemble. Remove the cling film from the swiss roll and cover the outer swiss roll with the remaining buttercream. We use a piping bag for this and pipe lines down sides of the roll then use a fork to create a textured log effect.\n8. Sprinkle with icing sugar and serve.\nNOTES\n1. You could use holly, sprinkles or vegan edible decorations for garnish, Christmas is the occasion to go all out with your decorating.\n2. For ease you could just use jam inside the yuletide log and buttercream the outside only.\n"

Fry for around ten to twelve minutes, turning frequently, until it has begun to crisp around the edges.\n\n\nAdd the chickpeas, mange tout, asparagus, and garlic to the pan with the tofu. Cook for three minutes, then add the cauliflower grains, olives, the juice of half a lemon, and black pepper.\n\n\nStirring frequently, cook for around 4-5 minutes until the cauliflower is tender but firm.\n\n\nCut the remaining half lemon into slices.\n\n\nServe with a slice of lemon on each portion.\n\n"

        "instructions": "\n\u00a0\n\nRemove the leaves from the cauliflower and cut into chunks.

Line 2 large baking sheets with greaseproof paper and a little coconut spray oil\n\n\nAllow the cooked cauliflower crumb to cool before transferring into a clean tea towel and squeezing as much moisture as you can out. (Really wring it!) You may need more than one tea towel\n\n\nTransfer the dehydrated cauliflower crumb into a bowl and add the remaining pizza base ingredients: ground chia seeds, protein powder (I used Pulsin Soya Protein powder), ground almonds, nutritional yeast, chia egg substitute, dried mixed herbs, a large pinch of salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper\n\n\nUsing your hands, divide the pizza mixture in half and place directly on each baking sheet. Shape into a ball and then press down to form a round pizza base shape\n\n\nBake for 15 mins until the bases are golden brown and starting to crisp a little at the edges. If you want your base extra crispy, half-way through baking, flip it over to ensure both sides are well baked\n\n\nWhilst the base is baking, mix together the ground flaxseed, sugar-free apple sauce, tomato pur\u00e9e, tamari, dried oregano, garlic and season with salt and pepper\n\n\nSpread the tomato topping onto each of the pizza bases\n\n\nThen top your pizza with your topping of choice. I Have chosen roasted vegetables and slices of basil pesto tofu. Sprinkle over with nutritional yeast\n\n\nTurn the oven up to 240\u00baC (220\u00baC fan) and bake for a further 12- 15 mins\n\n\nI love to serve mine with a large handful of fresh rocket on top and a side salad. Enjoy!\n\nThe key to making a great cauliflower crust pizza is by making a cauliflower crumb and then dehydrating it, so that as much moisture is squeezed out as possible, allowing the remaining crumb to be turned into a crispy pizza base. (If you don\u2019t squeeze out the moisture, the base will be all soggy). You will be surprised with the amount of liquid which comes out! But this delicious grain-free pizza is well worth the effort.\nThere are two ways you can dehydrate your cauliflower crumb: the more time-consuming method is by putting the cooked cauliflower crumb in a tea-towel or two and wringing out the moisture. (I think of this as stress relief!). Alternatively, if you are lucky enough to have a juicer, you can simply feed cauliflower florets through the juicer and collect the residual crumb and mix this directly with the remaining pizza base ingredients. (No need to cook before using!).\nSo why not give this recipe a go, to create a delicious vegan pizza chock full of vegetables!\nSO MAN\nwww.sobody.co.uk\nHello! I am So from SOBODYUK.

Run a palette or rounded knife on the inside edge of the cake pans first to make sure the cake comes out neatly. Cool completely.\nOnce you are ready to ice the cake, prepare the chocolate icing. In a bowl, melt 75g of dairy-free butter with boiling water. In a separate bowl, mix together the icing sugar with 1 1/2 tbsp sieved cocoa powder. Add the melted butter to the sugar mixture. Blend well until you have a smooth icing.\nAssemble the cake by placing one cake on a serving plate (having carefully removed the baking sheet). Spread some chocolate icing over the first cake then top with the other cake (from which you will also have carefully removed the baking sheet). Ice the cake all over with the chocolate icing with a palette knife. So it does not get too messy you can place some long strips of baking paper around the edges of the cake while you ice it. Leave to icing to set (around 20 mins).\n\nLove this recipe? Sign up to Veganuary today to get recipes like this delivered directly to your inbox.\n"

Once cooked to your liking, set aside.\nWhile the chickpeas and tomatoes are roasting, make your zoodles. You basically want to zoodle as much of the three zucchini as possible.

Next, slice a criss-cross pattern across the flesh \u2013 this ensures the butternut can soak up all of the lovely coconut oil and maple syrup (and helps it to cook more quickly).\nDrizzle half of the maple syrup onto each half of the butternut and into the scooped-out cavity, followed by the oil (the oil can be melted in advance, or spread on solid). Sprinkle on the cinnamon and thyme leaves.\nPlace on a baking tray and cook for 45 minutes to an hour. It may take longer depending on the size of the butternut; just keep an eye on it (and cover with foil if you think it\u2019s at risk of burning). It should turn a lovely caramelised brown, and should be soft, but not mushy.\nWhile the butternut is cooking, prepare the freekeh. This usually involves simmering it in water for about 15 minutes, but check the instructions on the packet.\nChop the onion, garlic and mushrooms and heat the oil in a frying pan. Cook on a medium heat with the dried chilli flakes until the onions are soft and lightly browned. Add the thyme leaves, cherries and pecans and give it all a stir, helping the cherries to absorb the lovely flavours. The aroma is amazing! Add the freekeh, stir to combine and remove from the heat.\nTo serve, pile some spoonfuls of the lovely stuffing into the butternut and reserve some for the table (or to eat the next day in a tasty salad).\n\n"

I mix it in a\u00a0metal bowl that I cool under very cold water before use so\u00a0even the mixing bowl is cold.\u00a0The butter needs to be very cold and firm.\u00a0If you\u2019re using\u00a0vegan margarine I recommend you put it in the freezer\u00a0for an hour or so to make it firmer.\n\nCut the very cold butter in chunks and place them\u00a0in a cold, large bowl.\u00a0Sift the flour over the butter chunks.\u00a0Mix flour and butter chunks with your hands quickly, using\u00a0your fingers to squish the butter chunks. Both ingredients\u00a0will make a smooth dough in about a minute. Don\u2019t knead too\u00a0long, it gets crumbly very quickly.\nWhen the flour and butter are just combined, add the sugar and\u00a0knead in quickly. As soon as all ingredients are mixed, stop\u00a0kneading. Form the dough into a roll of about 2 inches in\u00a0diameter, firmly wrap the roll into cling film and keep it in\u00a0the fridge for at least an hour. I keep it in a metal dish and\u00a0add the knife I\u2019m going to use to cut the cookies. That way,\u00a0the knife is cold, too.\nSet a timer so you don\u2019t forget to preheat the oven to\u00a0180C/356F at least 15 minutes before the cooling time for the\u00a0dough is over. Take the dough out of the fridge and unwrap. It\u00a0will be very firm now. You can now cut the dough in even\u00a0slices of about 0.4 cm / 1/16 inch.\nLine a baking tray with parchment and even the edges of the\u00a0cookies a bit with your fingers before you place them on the\u00a0baking tray. I bake them in two batches, the dough makes about\u00a040 cookies, they wouldn\u2019t fit on one tray.\u00a0Put the tray in the oven and bake for about 9-10 minutes. I\u00a0start to watch the cookies after 8 minutes because they burn\u00a0quickly. They will melt a little while baking. When the sides\nstart to brown, they\u2019re done but still tender.\u00a0Take the cookies from the baking tray quickly and let them\u00a0cool on a cooling tray. Even if you work with two baking\u00a0trays, it\u2019s not enough to take the tray out of the oven. It\u2019s\u00a0still hot enough to burn the cookies after taking them out of\u00a0the oven. They are still a little soft when they\u2019re fresh from\u00a0the oven and need to cool completely to firm up and turn\u00a0crispy.\nDone.\nThe one negative thing about those shortcrust cookies?\u00a0They need to rest for a couple of days in a cookie jar or tin\u00a0to reach their perfect texture.\nOnce you\u2019ve mastered working with this shortcrust dough, the\u00a0variations are endless:\n\nSprinkle them with sugar before baking.\nAdd lemon zest to the dough and cover the cookies with\u00a0lemon icing after cooling.\nAdd chopped hazelnuts to the dough.\nStick two cookies together with a layer of homemade\u00a0raspberry fudge in the middle. Dip those double decker\u00a0cookies in dark chocolate and let them cool.\n\nGuten Appetit!\n"

Blitz together, stopping regularly to scrape down the sides, until you have a smooth and creamy consistency.

Now, use your fingertip to mark little dents and hills all over the dough \u2013 because it is such a liquid batter, you won\u2019t be able to make solid holes, instead, just create little peaks and troughs in the surface of the bread. Now scatter over the rosemary leaves (if using), drizzle over the olive oil and sprinkle a little sea salt over the top.\nBake in the oven for 35 minutes or until just golden and crisp on top.

It is important to continue stirring the entire time your milk is on the hob.\nOnce the soy milk comes to a light, rolling boil, add the lemon juice and stir.

        "instructions": "\nMake the seitan following the instructions below:\n\nThere are loads of recipes for seitan and I am working my way through them, learning as I go. For this recipe I tried one by Isa Chandra (Chicken Stylee Seitan, available on thePPK.com) and because it was a big batch I tried a couple of different ways of cooking it. I think either way would work and I would definitely try the boiled method for this recipe next time.\n\n\nI followed the recipe by Isa Chandra up to the point of cooking. At that point, I separated the seitan dough in to two batches. With one, I followed the recipe, gentry cooking the seitan in stock. This was the most successful of my attempts so far. It is really, really important not to let it boil. I got all tech about it and dragged out the jam thermometer. I kept it between 94 and 98 degrees.\n\n\nAnyway, for this particular version, I took the other half of the seitan and formed it in to small nuggets. Keep them on the small side because they will expand on cooking. I put them on an oiled baking tray and covered them with tin foil and baked for 20 \u2013 30 mins at 180oC. Keep an eye on them, they are only small so it won\u2019t take much to burn them. My thinking with this was that it keep them dry and therefore make the coating stick better.\n\n\nIf you have the time, the stock method would work too but you would want to leave them to drain for quite a while and get as much stock out of them as you can before trying to do the coating.\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t fancy making your own seitan or you have your own preferred product or recipe, you could just use that. If you are still searching for that perfect recipe, give Isa\u2019s recipe a go.\n\n\n\nYou will need 2 bowls and a drying rack to complete all of the coating process and to also drain off the seitan once cooked.\n\n\nStart off by making the vegan butter milk. Combine the ingredients and then let sit for 5 to 10 mins whilst you get all the ingredients for the flour together and mix them well in a bowl. By the time you have got them all sorted, your buttermilk should be good to go.\n\n\nIn your second bowl, mix the buttermilk with the hot sauce and salt. You are now ready to being the coating process.\n\n\nAdd the seitan to the buttermilk and let soak for 10 mins. One soaked, add the pieces a few at a time to the flour and coat well before putting on the drying rack and leaving for another 5 to 10 mins. You can use this time to get your oil heated up. You want it at 180oC. Be careful, don\u2019t burn your house down or anything.\n\n\nOnce the seitan pieces have sat in the coating for 10 mins, we repeat the coating process. This helps more of the flour stick and also creates all sort of lumps, bumps and crevices which are going to make this really good. Straight in to the buttermilk, straight in to the flour and then in to the 180oC oil.\n\n\nThe most important tip I found was to leave the pieces along for at least 3 minutes otherwise you risk knocking the coating off. Overall mine took about 8 mins to get nice and golden. My pan was not big enough to cook the whole lot and yours probably won\u2019t be either so I did a couple of batches and kept the first batch warm in a low oven. I chucked the first batch in the oil again for a minute at the end, just because.\n\n"

        "instructions": "\n\nScrub and chop the sweet potato and boil until soft with skin still included (approximately 10 minutes). Then drain and place in a mixing bowl.\nCrush garlic and chop along with coriander leaves (as small as you can) with a sharp knife.\nAdd all ingredients into blender or food processor (EXCEPT the gram flour). I find this actually works best\u00a0 with a hand (immersion) blender. With a hand blender, you can apply downward pressure and get in there nicely\u2026 if you use a jug blender or food processor it will work fine if you keep scraping down the sides and loosen the mixture. Alternatively you could go for the real rustic effect and use a strong potato masher to do the job instead. Blend until most of the mixture is broken down. It doesn\u2019t need to be totally smooth; it can be quite rustic.\nOnce blended add the gram flour and continue to mix in with a spoon. If you leave it on the side for a while (half and hour or half a day) then it will firm up a little making it slightly easier to roll. I sometimes let it stand if I have time, but that\u2019s not essential.\n\u00a0Chickpea moisture varies from batch to batch. The mixture should be soft and pliable, easy to roll into a ball in your hands. Take a heaped teaspoon worth of mixture and roll a small ball (this should be smaller than a golf ball). The delightful yellowness glow of the turmeric will rub off a bit on your hands. If you\u2019d rather now yellow-out your hands then use extra gram flour to roll with. If your mixture is too soft to roll well, then add a little extra gram flour or use gram flour to roll in.\nPlace on a lightly oiled baking tray and bake in preheated oven at gas mark 6 or 7 (200\u02daC to 220\u02daC/ 400\u02daF to 425\u02daF) for approximately 30 minutes or until tanned.\nEnjoy!\n\n\u00a0\n\n"

        "ingredients": "\n\nAll listed in the Cooking Instructions\n\n",
        "instructions": "\nThe basics:\nGravy \u2013 Good gravy is a must. It ties everything together and is essential for mashing roasties into! This is my \u2018go-to\u2019 recipe:\n\nChop an onion and two/three cloves of garlic and chuck into a pan with a splash of olive oil and a large bay leaf or a good sprinkling of thyme\nOnce softened, add a generous teaspoon of Dijon mustard, and about the same of tomato puree\nChop up some kalamata olives or sundried tomatoes (a good handful and you can do both if you want) into little pieces and add to the pot\nAdd a dash of soy sauce, and a good shake of\u00a0smoked paprika (optional)\nBoil kettle and add enough water to the pot to suit number of guests\nAdd as many teaspoons of\u00a0Bouillon to match the hot water\nStir all the time!\nLet it simmer down until thick. I typically start a roast by boiling my potatoes for roasties (see below), and then start straight on my gravy, so it should have had enough time to thicken by the time it comes to serving. If you need to thicken it some more, just add a little cornstarch or flour (only a little at a time)\nRemove bay leaf (if using) before serving\n\nGravy additions: I have been known to add to this recipe by adding celery (after the onions and garlic), chopped cherry tomatoes, green olives, tapenade, extra onion, mushrooms, leeks, Marmite etc. Have fun with it! Anything that adds that umami flavour is always good. And if you want to easily increase the protein then add some lentils to the gravy \u2013 puy or green work best \u2013 or even beans (I like black beans!). Make it in your own signature style \ud83d\ude42\nRoast Potatoes \u2013 Forget everything else, what makes a roast is roasties! Loved by everyone, great cold later on, or in a Spanish omelette\u00a0the next day. I keep mine really simple\u2026\n\nCut potatoes into roastie-sized chunks. Leave the skin on!\nBoil until the skin starts to slightly peel off and the potatoes are soft\nPour potatoes into roasting tin (I often shove mine into the oven a few minutes before, so the oil sizzles when I pour them in) with a little olive oil, a little salt, lots of cracked pepper and either rosemary or thyme. (I have been known to use smoked paprika here too, or throw in a handful of garlic cloves \u2013 again, add the flavours that you love.)\nLeave in oven at about 220C for about 40 minutes, or for however long it takes for them to crisp up just as you like them.\n\nCarrots/Broccoli/Green Beans/Kale etc. \u2013 Great for crunch, colour and texture. You can cook these any way you want really, but for carrots, broccoli and beans I like to flash boil so they remain full of bite. None of those soggy veggies your Nana used to serve! Kale is great with a touch of oil in a pan, lots of pepper and sometimes a little garlic. If serving as a side, it is also lovely with some toasted sunflower seeds or pine nuts sprinkled on top.\nThe Crowd Pleasers:\nLentil loaf \u2013 I absolutely love this, and it is perfect with all the roasted trimmings! A great option for Christmas or Thanksgiving, and is excellent cold the next day \u2013 have it in a sandwich! In my mind, there\u2019s no need to reinvent wheels if someone has already made the perfect dish\u2026 and Vegan Richa has. I recommend you try this as soon as you can!\u00a0(It is also a protein-packed hit and a half! I have yet to meet an omnivore who\u00a0doesn\u2019t love this.)\n\nVegan Richa\u2019s Lentil and Quinoa Loaf\u00a0\n\nRoasted Cauliflower \u2013 Having never been a huge fan of cauliflower, I was initially sceptical about this. But the jungle drums are not lying\u2026 You simply have to try it! Easy, delicious, different, fun and extremely tasty; it is a great one to knock out for non-vegans. I have used this recipe from One Green Planet and been overjoyed with it every time:\n\u2018Cheesy\u2019 Whole Roasted Cauliflower\nGarlicky Roasted Sprouts \u2013 Sprouts get a bad rap, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair. When cooked right they can be sensational. I make this at Christmas as well as whenever I randomly happen to pick up sprouts, and it\u2019s always a winner. I use a whole bag of sprouts for this.\n\nWash your sprouts, chop the hard ends off and score an X in the bottom of each\nInto an oven-proof dish, add the sprouts (you can choose to cut them up a little here, or wait until later as I do), a good glug of olive oil, about the same of water, minced/finely chopped garlic (minimum of three cloves), a little salt and lots of cracked pepper\nPut them in the oven at about 220C and check on them in about 20 mins\nYou may need to add a little more water when you next check in them. Give the sprouts a good mix up and, if they\u2019re softening, mush a few up with the back of your spoon. This dish is great when you have a mix of whole sprouts and broken up bits\nPut back in the oven for approximately another 20 minutes \u2013 you may want to check, stir and mush about 10/15 mins in, just to ensure they\u2019re not burning.\nYou sort of have to decide when these sprouts are right for you. Some people like them really caramelised, others less so. So, again, it is a play around with kind of dish. I once thought I\u2019d completely ruined this, as I\u2019d burnt the outer edges of the sprouts early on, but I mixed them up, added a bit more water, mashed them a little and kept going. Everyone at the table loved them and had seconds. Best idea, however, is to do what I don\u2019t do\u2026 Make these once before the special occasion so you feel confident on the day!\n\nQuick and Easy:\nSometimes you don\u2019t have lots of time and that\u2019s when mock meats are just ace. Gravy, roast potatoes, some greens and one of these (or similar) and that\u2019s a roast in my book!\n\nFry\u2019s Sausages, Pies, or Thick Cut Strips \u2013 Great to have in the freezer! Whip up a load of veg and add one of these great products to the mix. Perfect for family meals with non-vegans \ud83d\ude42\nLinda McCartney Sausages \u2013 Comfort food for vegetarians and vegans alike, both the Original and Rosemary flavours are vegan.\nGranose Burger Mix \u2013 I love this stuff! One sachet makes four patties, and two for each plate seems to work well.\n\n\u00a0\n"

        "ingredients": "\n\nFor the honeycomb:\n5 tbsp granulated sugar\n2 tbsp golden syrup\n\u00bd tsp bicarbonate of soda\nFor the parfait:\n200g dark, dairy-free chocolate\n150g dairy-free margarine or coconut oil (at room temperature)\n2 tbsp golden syrup\n85g blanched almonds, or use the same weight in favourite gluten free, vegan biscuits if you can\u2019t have nuts, or stem ginger instead for extra flavour\n85g glace cherries\n100g dried cranberries\n\n",
        "instructions": "\n\nServes 8\nYou will need a 450g/1lb loaf tin for this recipe\n\n\nBegin by making the honeycomb. Generously grease a flat baking tray with vegetable oil. Melt the granulated sugar and golden syrup in a high sided saucepan over a low heat. Once melted, turn up the heat a little and bubble the syrup until it turns to a rich, caramel gold colour. Whisk in the bicarbonate of soda \u2013 this will make the syrup foam up, hence the high sided pan \u2013 and immediately pour the mixture onto your greased baking tray. Set the tray aside and leave it to cool for 20 minutes, before sliding the honeycomb off and chopping it roughly into small chunks for the parfait.\nNext, line the loaf tin with enough cling film to allow it to drape over the edges by about 3 inches, smoothing the cling film into the tin to form a crease free base.\nBreak up the dark chocolate and roughly chop the almonds. Place the chocolate, golden syrup and margarine in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water, stir together until melted and combined to a smooth and glossy finish.\nTake the bowl off the heat and stir in the chopped honeycomb, almonds, cherries and cranberries. Spoon the mixture into the lined tin and level the top. Fold the overhanging cling film loosely over the top of the parfait and then place in the freezer for 1 hour, remove from the freezer and transfer the parfait to the fridge until set. Once ready to serve, carefully lift the parfait from the tin, unwrap the cling film and cut into 2 cm slices to serve.\n\u00a0\nLike this recipe?

        "instructions": "\nCanned green jackfruit bears a resemblance to flaked crabmeat when cooked. It can be found in Indian and Asian markets or purchased through the internet. Look for the label \u201cGreen Jackfruit\u201d or \u201cYoung Green Jackfruit\u201d and be sure that it\u2019s packed in water or brine and not syrup. Cans of ripe jackfruit packed in syrup may be stocked nearby, but don\u2019t be tempted to substitute as the ripe fruit will be too sweet for this application.\n*Chef\u2019s note: Traditional ceviche made with fresh seafood has a fresh, clean flavor and should not be fishy. If you wish to add a subtle ocean flavor to this plant-based version add a little bit of dried kelp flakes or flaked, toasted nori.\n\nDrain the jackfruit and rinse. If the jackfruit was canned in brine, rinse thoroughly. Add the chunks of jackfruit to 1 quart salted boiling water. Reduce the heat to a slow boil and cook for 15 minutes. Drain in a colander and let cool. When cool enough to handle, remove the tough core from each chunk of jackfruit with a sharp knife and discard. Break the chunks apart with your fingers and remove the soft seeds and seed membranes and discard. The remaining flaky pulp is the only portion you will want to use in the dish, so sort through the chunks carefully (there will be a significant amount of unusable material). Wrap the pulp in a lint-free kitchen towel and squeeze to remove excess water. Coarsely chop the pulp and place in a mixing bowl.\nAdd the remaining ingredients EXCEPT for the avocado and toss well to combine. Refrigerate for several hours to marinate the ingredients and blend the flavors. Add the diced avocado just before serving and toss well. The avocado can also be placed into a ring mold and the ceviche layered on top for a lovely presentation. Season the ceviche with additional salt as desired and to taste. Serve with crunchy tortilla chips.\nTip: Strips of flour or corn tortilla that have been flash-fried in cooking oil make an interesting and crunchy garnish.\n\u00a0\nLike this recipe?

        "instructions": "\nServes 4\n\u00a0\n\n\nFinely chop the onions. Using a heavy based, lidded pan heat 2 tbsp of olive oil and add the onions giving them a quick stir so they get coated in the oil. Pop the lid on the pan and, keeping the heat low, sweat the onion for around 10 mins, stirring occasionally, until translucent. While the onion is cooking you can prepare the courgettes. Give them a wash, and cut away any damaged skin. Slice each courgette in half lengthways and slice into \u00bc inch pieces. When the onions are cooked, add the courgettes, bay leaf, herbs de Provence and mustard powder, give them a good stir, and balance the lid back on the pan so it is slightly ajar. The cooking time here will vary a little depending on the size of the courgettes but this should be around 20-25 minutes with the courgettes taking on a translucent appearance when they are cooked.\nWhile the courgettes are cooking, make the pesto. Using a food processor or a pestle and mortar blend together the pine nuts, garlic, mint and 4 tsp of the olive oil. Once a coarse paste is formed add the salt and the nutritional yeast. Give another quick blend so the new ingredients are integrated but the texture of the pesto remains coarse.\nOnce the courgettes are cooked, add the vegetable stock and grate in the nutmeg. Keeping the pan on a low heat stir well for a minute or two before transferring the contents to the blender (or leave in the pan if using a hand blender). Puree the soup adding some hot water if the soup is too thick, and return to the pan.\nZest the lemon. Cover the zest as it dries out incredibly quickly and set aside until serving. Disposing of any pips, squeeze the juice into the hot soup. Give a quick stir and check the seasoning.\nTo serve, ladle the soup into the serving bowls and grate over a little nutmeg. Rest a dollop of pesto on top of the soup then scatter over the lemon zest.\n\nLike this recipe? Sign up to Veganuary today to get recipes like this delivered directly to your inbox.\n"

        "instructions": "\n\nYou will need: A heart-shaped chocolate mould with 12 hearts. You can use any chocolate mould shape if you\u2019d prefer a different shape.\nYou can also watch a video demonstration of chocolate making\n\n\nStep One:\n\u2018Shave\u2019 the solid cocoa butter with a sharp knife or grater. Shaving is just really thin slicing that makes the cocoa butter crumble. The finer you can get it, the easier it will be to melt. You can leave it in big chunks if you like, but be prepared to wait a while for it to melt.\nStep Two: \nMelt the cocoa butter. You can do this by leaving it in a warm place in a heat proof glass bowl by a fire or directly above a hot radiator. It melts at 34\u02daC. The idea is to melt it, rather than cook it, maintaining its \u2018un-cookedness\u2019. If you don\u2019t have a gentle heat source then use a hob or stove.\nPut the cocoa butter in a small, oven proof, glass bowl and then put that bowl in a pan containing an inch or so of really hot water. Keep the hob/stove burning on a low heat. The heat will then transfer through the bowl, enough to melt the cocoa butter. Give it frequent stirs to assist the melting process. Don\u2019t keep it on the heat any longer than it takes to melt it.\nThe best time to use it is when it has just melted. If it is too hot, then it takes longer to cool down and the coconut sugar will sink to the bottom of the chocolate when added.\nStep Three: \nAdd the coconut sugar to the melting cocoa butter during step two. The melting cocoa butter will help to soften and dissolve the sugar.\nStep Four: \nWhen the cocoa butter has finally melted, mix in the cocoa powder and any other remaining ingredients.\nHere\u2019s the fun part!\nMaking chocolate hearts:\nPlace 1 teaspoon of your melted chocolate mixture into each heart-shaped well. When you\u2019ve put some in every heart, pop them into the freezer whilst you prepare and blend the filling ingredients.\nPrepare the filling:\nBlend all the filling ingredients together thoroughly and leave on the side whilst you make the chocolate.\nMaking chocolate hearts continued:\nTake your hearts out of the freezer (after about 10 minutes worth of chilling) and place the blueberry filling into each one. This is slightly fiddly! Use a teaspoon and a knife to help the process\u2026\nTake about \u00bd a teaspoon of filling and gently dollop it on top of the freshly chilled chocolate hearts. Aim right for the middle of the heart. You\u2019ll find that some always hits the edges\u2026 simply tease it back with your knife to create a thin gap at the edges (you\u2019ll see why next).\nTake the rest of your melted chocolate (you should have some left \u2013 if not \u2013 make some more) and pour 2 or 3 teaspoons over each dollop. Place your tray of hearts straight into the freezer to help your chocolates set. This should be ready in about 15 minutes. You can also set them by leaving in the fridge or any cool place (but allow extra time for setting).\nEnjoy!\n"

        "instructions": "\nTips:\n\nIf your peppers don\u2019t sit upright in the saucepan because there is space around them, then squeeze an onion or a potato in next to them to make them sit tight.\n\n\nAdd some olive oil to the pan of boiling water the peppers cook in. This will add a bit of flavour and soften them up nicely.\n\n\nIf you\u2019d prefer to use white rice, just cut out the first stage. Add your rice into the onion mixture without pre-cooking it.\n\n\n\nCook the brown rice for half of the time it suggests on the packet.\n\n\nWhile the rice is cooking you can prep the peppers and filling \u2013 Wash the peppers and cut the tops off, making sure the green stalk is still attached so you can use the top of the pepper for a lid. De-seed and place all six in a saucepan so they stand upright. Set aside.\n\n\nDice the onion and gently fry in a medium sized frying pan with a little olive oil. Dice the courgette into small pieces and add to the pan along with the crushed garlic. Add the currants and spices.\n\n\nBy this time your rice should be ready. Drain it and add it to the pan. Stir to combine everything, turn up the heat and add your stock. Once it starts bubbling turn down to a low heat and let simmer until the liquid has evaporated and the rice has fully cooked. Add more liquid if needed. Once cooked, taste and season.\n\n\nSpoon the rice into the peppers, filling them to the top, then place the top of the pepper back on. Repeat, so all six peppers are filled.\n\n\nCarefully pour some boiling water into the saucepan, which the peppers are sitting in, making sure not to pour it over the peppers. The water should come up to about half the height of the peppers. Put a lid on, turn the hob onto a medium heat and let them simmer for 30 -45 minutes until the peppers have softened.\n\nLike this recipe?

Add your cooked sweet potato when ready.\n3. Blend until smooth and creamy.\n4. At this point, set aside any sauce you don\u2019t want to use right away and pop in the fridge or freezer.\n5. To cook the sauce, pour into a non-stick saucepan or frying pan on a medium heat. Cook for 3-5 minutes until the sauce thickens and is hot but not boiling, then turn the heat down as it thickens. Make sure to stir continually with a flat bottomed spatula to stop anything sticking to the pan.\n6. When the sauce is thick and silky like a custard, take off the heat and add it to your favourite recipe immediately! (We like to pour over cooked macaroni, add a herby breadcrumb crumb and bake for 20 minutes in the oven for an easy and delicious mac n cheeze.)\n"

        "instructions": "\n\nInstructions\n\n\nMix: Place sugar in a small/medium size container and add the oil 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing in between. You want the consistency to be sandy, not soupy. If the mix is too soupy, the sugars will dissolve in a day or two and not slough the skin as well, but you will still get added moisture from the oil.\nTo Use: At the end of showering, pat the skin dry and gently rub the sugar scrub in a circular motion over your body, rinse well. I find it works best after soaking in the tub for at least 20 minutes. Soaking first will help soften the skin, allowing the scrub work to at its best, leaving your skin soft and supple!\nIt can be used 2 \u2013 4 times a week (depending on the sugar type).\nStore: Sugar scrub should be sealed when not in use and stored on a shower caddy or kept in a cabinet. It is best used within 1 month.\n\n"

Add your tomatoes to the baking sheet, you can coat these with oil too and add a sprinkle of sea salt.\nPlace your baking sheet into the oven, if using two, place sheets on separate racks or side by side, depending on the size. Bake for 15 minutes, gently flip \u2018steaks\u2019 and stir florets, season again and bake for an additional 15 minutes.\nServe immediately with roasted tomatoes, grain of choice, sprinkle of chopped parsley and lemon wedges.\nStore: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for 4 days, in a covered container.\n\n"

        "instructions": "\n\nInstructions\n\n\nSteep saffron: In a small bowl, add the saffron threads to 3 tablespoons warm water, let set 10 minutes to steep. If using turmeric, skip this step and add turmeric with the other spices.\nSaute: Heat olive oil/broth over medium heat in a large wide flat-bottomed pan or paella pan (a dutch oven or large pot would also suffice). Add onions and bell peppers, cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, green beans, tomatoes, smoked paprika, red pepper flakes and bay leaves, cook another 3 minutes stirring frequently. For softer veggies, cook another 7 minutes or so, totaling 10 minutes after adding the latter ingredients.\nAdd rice + broth: Add in the rice, broth, saffron mixture/turmeric and salt. Gently move the vegetables around so the rice falls to the bottom of the pan as much as possible. \nBoil + simmer: Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium or medium-low and cook at a continuous gentle boil, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Do not stir the rice. If using a large paella pan (15 inches or so) you\u2019ll want to rotate the pan over the burner every so often to help cook the rice evenly. Stay in the kitchen and clean up so you\u2019re right there to adjust the pan when needed. If liquids seem to boil off too quickly, add a little extra warm water/broth.\nAdd peas and artichokes: After 15 minutes of cooking, scatter the peas and artichoke hearts on top, cook for 5 minutes more. \nCover to steam: Turn off heat and cover for 10 minutes with a kitchen towel or other cover of choice. This will allow the rice to absorb any remaining liquid as well as steam the peas and warm the artichoke hearts and any other optional ingredients added as noted below. Once done, lightly fluff the rice and serve. Discard bay leaves before eating. Season with salt, pepper or more paprika to taste.\nServe: Garnish with chopped parsley. Pairs perfectly with a side of leafy greens and a big squeeze of lemon over top. Enjoy straight from the pan or serve in individual bowls.\nServes 4 \u2013 6\n\n"

        "instructions": "\n\nInstructions\n\n\nPress & cook tofu: If using firm or extra-firm tofu, you\u2019ll most likely want to press it a bit to remove excess water (if using super-firm tofu you can skip this step). Place tofu between a clean, double folded kitchen towel. Place a heavy book or pot over top to use as a press. Let set for at least 10 minutes, and up to 30 minutes. Once done, slice tofu into 1 inch pieces, about 1/4 inch thick. Heat a pan over medium heat, with 2 teaspoons of oil, twirl the pan to coat with oil. Place tofu in pan and cook about 4 \u2013 5 minutes, flip, sprinkle with a little garlic powder and cook another 4 \u2013 5 minutes. The time given here is for super-firm tofu. If using firm or extra-firm, you\u2019ll most likely need to cook about 4 minutes longer on each side. Tofu will be ready when golden on both sides. Set aside.\nMix dressing: In a small bowl, combine the ingredients for the dressing and mix well. Add water 1 tablespoon at a time to thin as needed. If dressing becomes to thin, add a little nut butter. Taste for flavor and set aside. Keep in mind that the flavors will mellow into each other as it sits. If using coconut amino\u2019s, you may want to add a pinch of mineral salt. Taste again for flavor before mixing with vegetables.\nPrep and cook vegetables: Once vegetables are prepped, heat wok or pan over medium-high heat. Add the bell peppers, carrots, green onions, cabbage and snow peas, cook stirring constantly for 2 minutes. We just want them to become ever so slightly softened (not too much). Add zucchini noodles and cook for 2 more minutes, stirring constantly to ensure everything cooks evenly. Remove from heat. Toss in tofu and cilantro, give a good stir. Add peanut dressing over top and mix well to coat.\nServe: Place portions in bowl and serve with lime wedges, chopped peanuts and optional bean sprouts. Easy, peasy \u2013 delicious!\nServes 2 generously or 3 smaller portions\nNOTES:\nIf you\u2019re a vinegar lover, feel free to add 1 tablespoon apple cider or rice wine vinegar to the dressing ingredients.\nIf allergic to peanuts, use sesame seeds instead (or cashews).\n\n"

Press down firmly filling in along the edges too.\nGlaze: Prepare your glaze by combining all ingredients in a small bowl, mix until incorporated. I recommend making each tablespoon heaping so you have plenty of this great sauce on top (if using tomato paste and mixture is too thick, add a teaspoon of water, or a little extra vinegar & syrup). Spread evenly over top the loaf.\nBake: Place in center of the oven, and bake in oven for about 45 \u2013 50 minutes.

To store longer, store in the freezer with freezer safe containers for 2 \u2013 3 months.\nNOTES:\nMix the beans up however you like using all of one type or your favorite combination. If you would rather use only 2 cans of beans, that\u2019s great too! I like adding more ingredients as it makes the chili go further. If using your own cooked beans you\u2019ll need about 4 1/2 cups.\nFeel free to use 2 packages tempeh instead of just 1. At times I like the extra dose of protein the tempeh adds and will double the amount making for an extra hearty chili. It\u2019s just so good!\nFor those who do not care for the taste of tempeh, I recommend making this a day ahead so the flavors really meld into the tempeh masking most of its natural flavor. Or try using the three grain tempeh as its flavor is not as strong.\nIf you find if you added too much heat from the chipotle, try adding a teaspoon or so of cocoa/cacao powder or organic sugar.\nUPDATED: This recipe was updated in Sept. 2019 with new photos and helpful tips. The only changes made to the recipe was adding a can of sweet corn. Since so many who commented on the recipe added it, I thought I would do the same. It\u2019s delicious, but optional!\n\n"

Fill each pan with a layer of dough, about 1/4 inch thick, by pressing firmly, yet gently into place. Fill each tartlet with cashew cream, almost to the rim, and level out, top with 1/3 cup of fruit. \nRemove: To remove tart from mold, gently lift the edges of saran wrap or parchment paper, place on a flat surface, and using a spatula carefully wedge under the tart and move to desired flat surface. \nMake ahead: You can prepare these a couple of hours ahead, cover them with saran wrap and store in the refrigerator until ready to eat.

Chop the cilantro.\nAvocado: The easiest and quickest way to dice an avocado for this recipe, is to slice it in half, remove the seed, using a knife, score the flesh in to segments, using a cross-hatch pattern, being careful to not break through the skin. Scoop it out using a large spoon, getting as close to the skin as possible, in one swoop.\nAssemble: In a large bowl, add the beans, corn, bell pepper, jalapeno, onion, avocado and cilantro. Pour the dressing overtop and toss well to coat. Taste for flavor.\nEat right away, or let the salad rest in the refrigerator for a few hours to let the flavors mingle.\nLeftovers will stay fresh for up to 4 \u2013 5 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator. I don\u2019t recommend freezing this salad/salad if adding avocado, if planning on freezing, omit the avocado and add it when serving. Freeze for up to 2 months.\nMakes about 2 quarts.\n\n"

Drain and set aside.\nMushroom sauce: In a large pan, heat oil over medium-high heat, add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms begin to sweat and release their juices, approx. 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and nutmeg, continue to cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Add the broth and let simmer for 1 minute. Lower the heat to medium-low and add the non-dairy milk. Cook until mixture thickens, stirring occasionally, approx. 6 to 8 minutes.\u00a0 Taste for seasoning, add more salt + pepper to taste. Remove from heat.\nAssemble & bake: Add the beans to the mushroom gravy and give a good stir. Place mixture in a baking dish and top with the baked onions. Place in oven, on the center rake, and bake until bubbly, approximately 15 minutes. If onions start to brown too much, cover with foil. Let cool slightly and enjoy.\nServes 6\nStore: Leftovers can be kept for up to 4 \u2013 5 days in the refrigerator.\n\n"

        "instructions": "\n\nInstructions\n\n\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F.\nVegan Buttermilk: Measure the milk and the juice of 1 lemon or apple cider vinegar, let rest for 5 \u2013 10 minutes to curdle.\nStrawberries: Place the strawberries in a medium bowl with 2 teaspoons pure cane sugar and combine. Set aside for at least 20 minutes. The longer they rest, the juicer (more macerated) they will become.\nShortcakes:\u00a0\nDry ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.\nCut the oil (or butter): Add the coconut oil and cut the oil into the flour using a fork or pastry blender. When done flour should be lumpy with little balls of flour.\nCombine dry and wet: Pour the vegan buttermilk into the flour mixture and mix to combine. Don\u2019t overmix the dough, mix just until combined.\nFlatten dough: Once dough is formed, place it on a lightly floured flat surface. Using your hands, flatten and mold the dough into a circle shape about 1/2 inch thick (a rolling pin will work too).\nCut dough: Cut circles using a 3 inch cookie cutter (a glass is ok too). Dip the cutter in flour before each cut to keep it from sticking. Leftover dough can be reshaped and cut. You should get 12 shortcakes.\nPrep for baking: Place the shortcakes on an UNGREASED baking sheet, or lined with a silpat or parchement paper. Make sure the sides are touching each other, this will make them cling to one another, rising bigger and taller.\nGarnish biscuits: Brush the tops with a little almond milk and sprinkle with pure cane sugar or turbinado. The sugar will give the shortcake tops a nice crunchy texture.\nBake: Place shortcakes in the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Let cool a few minutes before assembling your strawberry shortcakes.\nAssemble shortcakes: To serve, slice shortcakes in half, top with strawberries and generous dollop of vegan whipped cream.\nMakes 12 strawberry shortcakes.\nStore leftover biscuits, covered, on the counter for 4 days. Or keep them stored in the refrigerator for up to 7 \u2013 10 days. You can also freeze them for up to 2 months (let thaw on the counter or in the fridge). Warm them back up in a toaster oven.\nNOTES:\nTypes of flours: My favorite is unbleached all-purpose when making shortcakes. It yields the most tender and fluffiest biscuits. You could also try half all-purpose and half whole grain, just don\u2019t skimp on the oil or butter.\nTips for cutting biscuits:\n\nTo keep the dough from sticking to the cutter, keep a small bowl or plate of flour nearby and dip the cutter into the flour, shaking any loose flour away, before making cuts.\nDon\u2019t twist the cutter when making cuts, it creates a seal and the biscuits won\u2019t rise as well.\n\nRecipe adapted from Sally\u2019s Baking Addiction\nRECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT:\u00a0I love my\u00a0Silpat or\u00a0these\u00a0parchment liners for lining the baking sheet, and these fluted cookie cutters and pastry blender (affiliate links) work great too!

Add more water as needed to thin, no more than 1 cup should be needed. Taste for seasoning and heat on low as needed to warm.\nCroutons: While the soup is cooking or cooling, cube two slices of your favorite bread (I used the end pieces). Place cubes on a small baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil, add a pinch of salt, and toss well to coat. Toast in a toaster oven as if toasting bread (this was my method using the small tray that came with the toaster oven).

Mash your bananas and measure your nut butter.\nMix wet & dry: Combine the wet ingredients with the oat mixture. Toss and mix to coat well.\nLayer: Spread mixture evenly on a lined or lightly greased baking sheet (I used two baking sheets). You can either lightly compact the mixture or loosely spread it out a bit. If compacting, you\u2019ll want to mix the granola when rotating after 30 minutes.\nBake: Bake for 30 minutes. Turn and rotate sheet/sheets, bake for an additional 25 \u2013 30 minutes. Keep an eye towards the end, so it doesn\u2019t over brown (ovens run differently), cover with foil if it starts to brown too much.\nLet cool: Remove from oven, granola will be somewhat soft at first. Let cool for 15 minutes, break up into chunks, especially the center part if you\u2019ve compacted the mixture. Let granola cool completely to harden.\nMakes about 6 cups.\nStore: Let cool completely before storing. Keep granola in covered containers on the counter for up to 2 weeks or in the refrigerator for up to 2 months.\n\n"

If the peppers need to be heated, using the same baking dish you cooled the peppers in, place under broiler on low for a minute or two, watching closely so nothing burns.\nServe: Top with a drizzle or dollop of cashew cream and avocado slices. Salsa would also be great. I also loved having some warmed corn tortillas on the side as well.\nServes 4\nStore: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, in a covered container.

Lastly, add the broth and pepper, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for about 30 minutes. Season to taste.\nAssemble soup bowls. Ladle soup into individual, oven safe, bowls. Add 1 or 2 slices of the baguette on top of the soup, and add a layer of cheese and sprig of thyme. Place bowls on a rimmed baking sheet as shown above right.

Add the garlic powder, poultry seasoning and nutmeg, mix well, add in the sausage and stir another minute or so. Mixture will form a ball of sorts. Slowly add the milk and continue to stir, bring just to a boil, reduce heat to medium and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until gravy has thickened to desired consistency, about 10 minutes. Use the back of the spoon/fork to help break up the sausage if needed. Gravy will thicken a bit more as it cools. Season with plenty of pepper and salt to taste. Set aside with lid on, or slightly askew stirring every now and then until ready to serve. If gravy cools too much, heat over low until warmed.\nBiscuits: Make your buttermilk by combining the milk with the lemon juice. Let set for about 10 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F. Lightly flour a flat surface (use a cutting board, marble slab, etc). Leave a little extra flour on the side for your fingers and the biscuit cutter. Line a baking sheet with a silpat or lightly grease with oil.\nIn a medium size mixing bowl, add the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt, mix well to combine. Add the chilled butter and cut it into the flour using a pastry blender or the back of a fork. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s ready when the butter is about pea sized and the mixture is crumbly looking. Add in the milk and mix until just combined, making sure there are no flour patches. The dough should form into a rough ball, it should be tacky not sticky. If mixture is too wet & sticky, add a little extra flour and mix just a needed.\nPlace dough on the prepared floured surface, pat it down into a rough circle or rectangle about 1 inch thick, fold dough onto itself. Repeat 2 more times (this will make for flaky biscuits). Add extra flour to your fingers or dough as needed. Gently flatten the dough to about 3/4 inch thick. Using a 2 1/2 inch cookie cutter, place cutter in the reserved flour, tap the cutter on the flat surface to remove any excess and press the cutter into the dough, repeat. As much as you feel you want to, do not twist the cutter in the dough as it crimps the edges and will interfere with proper rising. Place biscuits on prepared baking sheet, brush with a little olive oil or cashew milk over top if you like. Place in the oven on the middle rack for 15 -18 minutes.\nMakes approx. 10 biscuits. You can get 12 if you rework the dough scraps. They won\u2019t be the prettiest biscuits but they\u2019ll still taste great.\nServe: Split the biscuits open face and serve gravy over top.

Be sure to use a large pot filled just under half way when cooking soba noodles. Once the noodles have come to a boil, the water tends to foam up quickly and overflow (ugg, I\u2019ve learned from experience). Pay attention and reduce the heat as needed to prevent the water from boiling over while keeping the water at a gentle rolling boil. Most importantly, when done rinse the noodles right away under cool running water to keep them from cooking (or else you\u2019ll have mushy noodles on your hands).\nMiso Broth: Heat your water in a small pan until nicely warmed, but not boiling, (use the pot the noodles were cooked in to save a dish). Remove from heat, add miso and mix until miso is dissolved. This keeps the miso from overheating and killing the beneficial probiotics. You can opt to keep it on the burner on low to keep warm until veggies are done.\nAssemble soup: Add noodles and vegetables to your serving bowl, top with broth and add a few of the garnishes.

        "ingredients": "\n\n\n\n\n\nScale\n1x2x3x \n\n\n\n\n3 acorn squashes, cut in half lengthwise and seeds removed\nolive oil (to roast oil-free see notes)\n1 teaspoon thyme, divided\nsea salt\n\nWild Rice Medley\n\n1 cup wild rice, dry (I used half black wild rice and half long grain brown rice)\n1 tablespoon olive oil or 1/4 cup water \n1 medium/large red bell pepper, diced\n1 small onion or 1 large shallot, diced\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n8 oz. mushrooms (about 2 cups), sliced\n2 large handfuls baby spinach (baby kale or chard is great too, or a combo)\n1 can cannellini beans (15 oz), drained and rinsed\n1 teaspoon thyme (dried or fresh)\n1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, optional\nsea salt and cracked pepper to taste\n\n\n",
        "instructions": "\n\nInstructions\n\n\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment or silicone mat. In an ovenproof saucepan, fill halfway with water and place on the bottom rack (this will give a little steam to your squash). \nPrep and roast the squash: Cut and seed your squash, place on baking sheet with cut side up. Brush each half with a little oil, and season with a sprinkle of thyme, salt and pepper. Place in the oven and bake for 40-45 minutes, until tender, knife should easily pierce the flesh. If by chance your squash is done first, cover with foil to keep it from drying out.\nRice: Cook your rice according to package directions. Wild rice will take about the same time as the squash to cook, about 40-45 min. Set aside.\nVeggies: In large pan, heat oil on medium heat. Add onion and cook for 5 minutes, add garlic and cook 1 minutes. Add the mushrooms, bell peppers, thyme, red pepper flakes, a few twists of salt and pepper, cook for another 5 minutes or so, until the mushrooms start to sweat and soften. Add the beans and leafy greens, stir frequently until they are wilted and warmed through (you may also want to use a cover in between stirring to help soften the greens). \nWild Rice Medley: Combine the rice and saut\u00e9ed vegetables in the larger of the two pots. Taste for seasoning adding additional salt and pepper as needed.\nStuff: Scoop mixture into each acorn squash half and serve with any additional seasonings. I actually like to top mine with some sriracha for that extra heat and flavor I love so much. :)\nServes 6 (or 3 for the hearty eaters).\nStore: Leftovers can be kept in an airtight container in fridge for up to 4 \u2013 5 days.\nNOTES:\nQuinoa or quinoa/rice combo would be great too and add even more protein per serving.\nTo make this oil free, omit the oil when roasting the squash and roast the squash cut side down to keep the moisture in. You can still add a little salt and pepper, and place a sprig of thyme underneath so the flavor with infuse the squash a little. Use water in place of oil when sauteing the vegetables.\nRECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT:\u00a0I love my\u00a0Silpat\u00a0or\u00a0these\u00a0parchment liners\u00a0for lining this\u00a0rimmed baking sheet\u00a0(affiliate links).

        "instructions": "\n\nInstructions\n\n\nSoak beans: The night before, rinse beans in colander with cold running water. Pick through and remove any broken or shriveled beans. Place beans in large pot with 5 or 6 cups water and cover to soak overnight.\nPre-Cook Beans: Next day, drain beans and rinse again. Place beans back in pot, add water, bring to a boil and simmer covered for 1 hour, drain and rinse.\nOrange: Juice the orange and set the juice aside. Reserve the orange halves for the soup.\nCook Soup: To the pot of freshly cooked beans, add the bay leaves, garlic, cumin, paprika, onion, celery, carrots, bell pepper, water/broth, orange halves, salt and pepper, reserving the orange juice for later. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 40 minutes to one hour, or until beans and vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally. Add extra water as necessary (I used another 1 cup of water).\nPuree: Once beans are tender, remove the orange halves and bay leaves. Use an immersion blender to blend soup to desired consistency. I blended about 3/4, leaving some chunkiness. You could also use a food processor/blender (this method may take two batches to complete). Blending is optional, you may like it chunky as is. Add the orange juice to the pureed soup and cook another 5-10 minutes.\nTo Serve: Serve alone or over a bed of cooked buckwheat, farro or brown rice. Top soup with a dollop of Sour Cream, Lime Cilantro Cashew \u2018Sour Cream\u2019 or Paprika Cashew Crema. You may also like to top it with diced onion, tomatoes, bell peppers, avocado, jalapenos, a squeeze of lime and/or cilantro.\nServes 4 generously, or 6 smaller portions.\n\n"

        "instructions": "\n\nInstructions\n\n\nFirst step: To rinse the rice or not? It is recommended to rinse rice before cooking to remove any loose starches that may make your cooked rice to become gummy. I almost never do this, but if you find your rice does become gummy, you may need to make a habit of it. If using canilla rice, which calls for skipping this step to keep all the nutrients, I\u2019ve never had a problem with gumminess using this rice.\nStovetop: Add the rice, water, garlic powder, bay leaf and salt to a medium sauce pan, add the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook over a gentle boil for 18 \u2013 20 minutes. Remove from heat, remove cover and let rest for 5 \u2013 10 minutes. Remove bay leaf. Add the cilantro and lime, and fluff with a fork. Taste for salt and add more lime or cilantro to taste.\nRice Cooker: Add the rice, water (see manufacturer\u2019s instructions for amount), garlic powder, bay leaf and salt to the bowl of your rice cooker. Pour the water overtop and cook according to manufacturer\u2019s manual. Once the rice is finished, remove bay leaf. Let cool a few minutes, add the cilantro and lime juice, fluff with a fork. Taste for salt and add more lime or cilantro to taste.\nInstant Pot: Add the rice, water and salt to the bowl of your instant pot. Attach the lid and turn to lock the lid. Set the steam valve to SEAL. Cook white rice for 4-8 minutes. If using other rice, see this instant pot cooking chart. Allow the pressure to release naturally for 10 minutes and then carefully release any remaining pressure.\nServes 4\nStore: Leftover rice can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4 \u2013 5 days, kept in an airtight container. If planning on storing leftovers, be sure to cool it quickly and store it within 2 hours to avoid bacteria growth.

Reheat the rice in a pot over medium-low heat on the stovetop, stirring occasionally until heated through.

I suggest adding in 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or water at a time. If you find your cream is a bit too runny, add in a few cashews and blend. You can serve at room temp or refrigerate a bit before serving. The cream can be made a day or two ahead of time.\nSimple Syrup: Combine either the dates, water, and vanilla OR maple syrup and vanilla into a small blender (I used the magic bullet) and blend until smooth. Feel free to add a tad bit more water as needed to thin if using dates. You can serve at room temp or refrigerate a bit before serving. The simple syrup can be made a day or two in advance.\nPlums: Slice your plums thinly just before serving. I have given a more detailed way of slicing above. Here is the simple version: I placed my plums on a flat surface with the stem side up and sliced as thinly as I could by hand with a sharp knife starting from the outside and slicing in until I came to the seed in the middle. Do this for both sides.\nAssemble: Place the plums however you like on your plate. Serve with a nice drizzle of the simple syrup and a dollop of the lemon ginger cream.

        "instructions": "\n\nInstructions\n\n\nSpanish quinoa (serves 6):\n\nIn medium size pan or skillet, heat oil over medium high heat, add onion, optional bell pepper and cook for 3 minutes, add quinoa and garlic, cook another 5 minutes or so stirring frequently until quinoa starts to get toasty and turn slightly golden. \nAdd water, tomato paste, oregano, salt + pepper, bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes. \nWhen done, remove cover, fluff with the a fork, and let set for 15 minutes to absorb the rest of the liquids. Taste for seasonings before serving.\n\nNut meat (makes 6 tacos): \n\nPlace all ingredients in food processor/blender and pulse until you have chunky crumbles. Don\u2019t over process or you will have a nut mushroom pate, which wouldn\u2019t be so bad but we want a crumbly effect here. For visual steps, see this Walnut Meat recipe.\nOptionally, heat the nut meat on low just until warm in a small saucepan. You don\u2019t want to overheat or the mushrooms will cook too much, just slightly warm it. I find both ways, warm and room temp, to be just as appealing. Makes enough for 6 tacos.\n\nWarm your tortillas on the griddle or skillet for 30 seconds per side.\nServe: Put your plates and tacos together as you wish! You may find that you end up combining the black bean salsa with the Spanish fried quinoa. You may also find yourself making tacos out of both of those side dishes as well. However you craft your plate, enjoy!\n\n"

Add a little sweetener of choice (I use a drizzle of maple syrup) and some fresh berries such as blueberries, raspberries, blackberries. Sliced strawberries and/or bananas would also be great.

Add coconut flakes and gently toss making sure to coat each flake well, toss for about 45 seconds or so.\nLayer: Using a slotted spoon, scoop seasoned coconut flakes and place onto a lightly greased, or parchment paper lined, rimmed baking sheet in a single layer. The key is to stir during baking to cook evenly. Sprinkle lightly with a bit of mineral salt if desired.\nBake: Place in oven and bake for 15 minutes. Set the timer for intervals of 5 minutes and stir each time making sure to rearrange all pieces by bringing the center flakes to the outside, and the outside flakes to the center for even cooking. If making a double batch and using two cookie sheets, you may even like to change the position of the sheets in the oven after the second interval, moving the top sheet to the bottom rack and vice versa. Remove when coconut has a nice browned and caramelized color.\nIf for some reason you need to bake longer than 15 minutes, keep close and watch as the coconut bacon can burn very quickly at this point. I really babied my coconut bacon towards the end, it\u2019ll be worth your while if you do too so it doesn\u2019t burn. \nCool:\u00a0Let cool, it will get crispy as it cools.\nStore: Once completely cooled you can store leftovers in an airtight container and keep in the pantry for up 1 to 2 months. If it softens a bit, re-crisp in the toaster oven on medium for a few minutes, or under the broiler for a few seconds, keeping an eye that it doesn\u2019t burn.\nMakes 28, 2 tablespoons, servings.\n\n"

        "instructions": "\n\nInstructions\n\n\nMAKE THE DOUGH:\nMix: In a very large mixing bowl combine the water, yeast and salt. If adding herbs, now is a good time, use a teaspoon or so of your favorite herbs or double if using fresh. Add flour all at once and stir with a wooden spoon. Takes only a minute, if that. No need to knead, just mix. You just want everything mixed well, no streaks of flour left, and you\u2019re done.\nRise: Cover container loosely (I used a towel to cover). Let it rise in a warm area with no draft, may take anywhere from 2 to 4 hours depending on temperatures (ideal temp is 80 \u2013 90).\nSeparate: Once done, if making the master recipe, pull away 1/4 of the dough and refrigerate the rest to bake later. Store unused dough covered tightly with plastic wrap in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.\nShape:\u00a0Lightly dust your hands and flat surface with flour, or cornmeal, so it won\u2019t stick. Take your dough and place it on the floured flat surface, gently pull the sides of the dough toward the bottom, rotating the dough until you get a roundish shape with a smooth surface. Also, don\u2019t worry if the bottom is a little bunched, it will flatten out upon the second rising.\nRest:\u00a0Place your dough ball onto a flat surface lined with parchment paper (if not using parchment paper, place on flat surface dusted with cornmeal or flour), and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. No need to cover it. If the dough has been refrigerated, it helps to let it rest a little more, until it\u2019s no longer chilled.\nBAKE THE DOUGH:\nPreheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Placing a cast iron skillet, pizza stone, roasting pan or shallow fry pan in the oven to get it nice and hot (a baking sheet will be fine too). Let the oven preheat for 30 minutes.\nPrep oven and dough: When ready to bake, place a rimmed cookie sheet or small pot with at least 1 cup of water on the bottom rack to steam \u2013 this will help the crust get nice and crispy, but it\u2019s fine if you skip it. Line your baking vessel with parchment paper or lightly flour with cornmeal. Dust a little flour on top of your loaf, using a knife slash the top, about 1/4 inch deep, in a cross, tick tac toe or scallop pattern (this helps the bread expand when baking while also giving it a rustic look).\nBake: Place prepped dough in center of baking vessel and place in the oven, center rack, for 30 \u2013 40 minutes, until you get a nice brown crust. Carefully remove from oven, let cool a few minutes and enjoy!\n\n"

        "ingredients": "\n\n\n\n\n\nScale\n1x2x3x \n\n\n\n\n1 \u2013 8 peppers, any color\n\nIf making a large batch and storing in the freezer\n\nparchment paper\nair tight containers that are freezer safe\n\nFor storing in jars\n\nvinegar (plain, balsamic, white/red wine, or apple cider)\nmineral salt\nolive oil\nclean pint sized mason jars\n\n\n",
        "instructions": "\n\nInstructions\n\n\nPREPPING PEPPERS:\nThere are two ways to prepare your peppers for roasting.\n\n The first is to simply roast the whole pepper, seeds, stem and all. (This will work with all roasting methods.)\n The second is to slice the peppers in half lengthwise, remove the stem and seeds, and place on the baking sheet cut side down. (Use this method for the oven method and/or when using a baking sheet. These peppers require no flipping, only rotating of the baking sheet. This is my favorite way of roasting peppers.)\n\nROASTING METHODS:\nOven: Preheat oven to 475 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment or a Silpat. \nPlace peppers on baking sheet. Bake 4 \u2013 5 inches from the flame. If using an electric oven or there is no flame, place baking sheet on the middle rack. Roast peppers for 40 minutes, turning at least once during cooking using sturdy tongs (if peppers are sliced in half no need to turn, just rotate the baking sheet 180 degrees). They are ready when charred/blackened and blistered. Whole peppers will still be full of air and puffy once removed from the oven. As the peppers cool they will deflate and become wrinkly looking.\nBroiler: I used to have an oven where the broiler was underneath the oven, now mine is in the oven. Either way, turn broiler to medium \u2013 high (or 500 degrees if yours is by numbers) and char peppers turning every so often until browned and blackened. If you\u2019ve prepped your peppers by slicing in half, no need turn the peppers, simply adjust the baking sheet turning it to get all the peppers charred. This may take anywhere from 15 \u2013 25 minutes.\nOpen Grill: Place whole peppers on their sides over an open flame on the grill, turning every now and then until nicely charred all over. Depending on how big your grill is will determine how many you can do at one time.\nStove Top: If roasting just 1 or 2 peppers, you can roast it over the gas burner of your stove (I suppose you could do 4 peppers utilizing each burner). Place pepper on its side and adjust the flame so it \u2018licks\u2019 the peppers. Keep an eye on it and turn it as needed to blacken and char, about 15 \u2013 20. This tends to be a more time consuming method since you have to be so watchful.\nSTEAMING & PEELING:\nWhile peppers are hot from the oven, carefully place them in a bowl and cover with a plate, or use a pot with lid. The goal is to steam the peppers making the skin peel easily. Let the peppers steam for about 30 minutes. Once peppers are cool, remove the skins, stems and seeds. I find it easiest to peel the pepper from the bottom to the top. A few seeds left are fine. Do not run peppers under water to clean, you\u2019ll lose most of the roasted flavor that you worked so hard get. Keep as much of the pepper juices as you can if storing leftovers.\nFrom here you can use right away to make hummus, romesco, soups, layer on sandwiches and toss in salads, etc.\nSTORING:\nRerfrigerator:\u00a0Great for short term storage.\n\nKeep leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a 5 \u2013 6 days. \nIf you coat them with a little oil they will for a couple of weeks. You can even add some of the pepper juices to the container. \nTo always be safe, at the first sign of mold or spoilage, throw away immediately.\n\nIf storing for longer, you have a couple simple options:\nFreezing:\u00a0This is my favorite method of long term storing, as it is not blended with any other flavors, it\u2019s super easy to do, and they thaw out amazingly well.\n\nFreeze your peppers in a tightly sealed container. They thaw out pretty fast once removed from the freezer making this a nice way of preserving your precious peppers. \nThis method of storing is a neutral way of keeping the full roasted flavor intact as they won\u2019t be tainted with any other flavors. \nI would suggest cutting and placing a small piece of parchment paper between the peppers for easy removal. \nWill last up to 2 months.\u00a0\n\nVinegar Method:\u00a0This is method will leave your peppers with a little bit of tang from the vinegar, in some cases it may overpower them, but it\u2019s a great way to store them. Use these peppers for sauces, dips, and soups.\n\nPlace peppers in a jar with a little salt, vinegar and pepper juices. \nTo do this you\u2019ll want to sprinkle your peppers with a generous pinch of mineral salt and mix well. \nPlace 1/2 inch of vinegar at the bottom of your pint sized mason jar, add peppers leaving about 1 1/2 inches headspace. \nUsing the handle of a spoon or fork, poke along the inside edges of the jar to release air bubbles (this is important), pour reserved pepper juices over top so peppers are completely covered, leaving 3/4 inch room. \nAdd about 1/8 inch of olive oil over top to keep air out, leaving 1/2 inch headspace. \nSeal and place towards the back of the refrigerator. Will be good for up to 2 months, maybe even a little longer. \nIf you see any sign of mold or spoilage, throw away immediately!\n\n\n"

Organic is best, especially if cooking with the skins on!\nI\u2019ve used all fuji apples which were delicious and on the sweeter side. So if you prefer your applesauce to be very sweet use only fuji.\nAs for combinations, my favorites are a mix of fuji and granny smith apples or a mix of honey crisp, granny smith and fuji. These combos balance each other out well, having just the right amount of natural sweetness and tartness.\nTo peel or not to peel your apples?\n\nPeeling: It takes a bit longer to prep but the end result is a little easier since you\u2019ll simply need to mash the apples with a potato masher, back of a fork or back of a slotted spoon.\nNo Peel:\u00a0The prep time moves along quicker, but the end time may take a little longer with the need to use an immersion blender, or transferring the cooked apples to a blender or food processor, to get a smooth consistency. The clear advantage of not peeling your apples is the health benefits, apples skins have antioxidants and fiber.\n\n\n"

If cream is too thick and extra water 1 tablespoon at a time until desired consistency, being careful not to thin it out too much making it runny, if in doubt leave it on the thick side. Taste for seasoning, set aside.\nSaute veggies: In large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion, garlic and cook until onions become soft. Add in mushrooms, broccoli, kale, thyme and salt & pepper to taste, cook for another 5 minutes or so. Turn off heat and cover ajar to help steam and soften the veggies a little more while working on the next step.\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place pizza stone or cast iron pizza pan in the oven to heat up.\nMake calzone: On a lightly floured surface or parchment paper, roll each portion out into an eight inch oval, rectangle, circle \u2013 whatever works easiest for you. Lay on some of the veggie mixture, add a few heaping tablespoons of the garlic miso cream and top with tomatoes. Fold the other half over and seal the edges by pressing with a fork. Make a few small slits in the top so steam is able to release. Top with a light coat of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt, pepper and thyme.\nBake: Dust the heated pizza stone with cornmeal, place calzone on the pizza stone (or if using parchment paper, transfer to pan or stone) and bake for 15 \u2013 20 minutes, until crust is puffy and golden brown. Let cool a few minutes before serving.\nServe with garlic miso sauce on the side.\nStore: Calzones can be kept in a covered container in the refrigerator for up 4 days.

        "instructions": "\n\nInstructions\n\n\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F.\nSoak Cashews: Soak, covered with 1 inch of very hot water for 5 \u2013 10 minutes to help soften them up so they blend ultra creamy. If you have nut sensitivities, soak the cashews in cool water for 2 \u2013 3 hours to aid in digestion.\nPrep: Dice the artichoke hearts and prep the spinach.\nCashew Cheese: Using your favorite blender, add the soaked cashews, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, lemon juice, salt and pepper, and liquids to the bowl and process until nice and smooth, about 3 minutes or so. Taste for flavor, adding more of anything as needed.\nAssemble: In a small or medium sized baking dish, add the spinach and artichoke hearts, pour the cashew cheese overtop and mix to combine. Wipe along the rim of the baking dish before baking for clean finish if you like.\nBake: Place in the oven, covered for 10 minutes, remove cover and bake another 10 minutes. Feel free to adjust the cover at any time to your preference (for me, sometimes I leave it covered the entire time).\nServe: Serve as is or give a good stir before serving. This dip is great warm or at room temperature, and is delicious scooped up with a sliced baguette or homemade crusty bread, pita chips, crackers or fresh vegetable sticks.\nWould be great with a light dusting of Almond Parmesan too!\nStore: Leftovers can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, in a covered container. Reheat in preheated oven set to 375 degrees for 10 \u2013 15 minutes, or until warmed through.\n\n"

Wide mouths are preferred as it\u2019s much easier to spoon out of for eating.\nServes 4 \u2013 6\nStore: Keep breakfast jars in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\n\n"

        "ingredients": "\n\n\n\n\n\nScale\n1x2x3x \n\n\n\n\n1 block (14 oz.) organic tofu (firm, extra or super firm)\n1/2 of a fresh pineapple\n1 red bell pepper\n1 large zucchini\n1 large red onion,\n\nPineapple-Teriyaki Sauce\n\n1/2 cup coconut amino\u2019s or low-sodium tamari or soy sauce\n1/2 cup pineapple juice\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n1/2 teaspoon ground ginger or 1 teaspoon fresh grated\n2 tablespoons pure maple syrup, coconut sugar or pure cane sugar, optional\n2 T. tapioca powder or 1 T. cornstarch + equal amount of water\n\n\n",
        "instructions": "\n\nInstructions\n\n\nPress tofu: Drain tofu and place between a clean double folded kitchen towel, or paper napkins. Place a medium stainless steel pot on top to help press the tofu, releasing it of excess moisture. If using super-firm tofu, skip this step. Let set while making the sauce. If using bamboo skewers, at this time you may also like to soak them in water to keep them from burning on the ends.\nMake Sauce: In a small saucepan, add coconut amino\u2019s/tamari, pineapple juice, garlic, ginger and optional sweetener, bring to a boil, reduce heat and cook on low for 1 minutes. In a small bowl, mix together the cornstarch/tapioca powder with the water until smooth. Add the mixture to the teriyaki sauce and cook another minute, or until sauce thickens. Remove from heat, cover and set aside. If you like your teriyaki sauce on the sweeter side, add an extra tablespoon or two of your preferred sweetener. \nPrep tofu & veggies: Cut tofu into 3/4 \u2013 1 inch cubes, place in a shallow baking dish and add about 1/3 \u2013 1/2 of the sauce, gently toss to coat tofu, cover and let marinate for at least 30 minutes. Chop and prep the veggies. Thread tofu & veggies on the skewers, distributing evenly, in whatever order you like.\nGrill: Turn on grill to medium high and coat with oil. Once grill is nice and hot, add skewers and cook, turning every so often, until tofu is slightly charred and vegetables are fork tender (or al dente if you prefer), about 8 minutes. Brush with a little sauce on the skewers while cooking if you like. Just be sure to save some for dipping later or adding over top of your grain.\nServe warm with grain of choice. I made a garlic cauliflower rice with chopped cilantro that was pretty darn good! This ginger cauliflower rice would be great too!\nNOTES:\nIf you don\u2019t have pineapple juice on hand, puree 1/2 cup of fresh pineapple and add enough water to equal 1/2 cup, mix well.\n\n"

        "instructions": "\n\nInstructions\n\n\nPreparing Cabbage: Quarter cabbage and chop laterally into about 2 inch pieces. Place cabbage in an extra large bowl or pot. Combine salt with 2 cups of lukewarm water, stir to dissolve salt. Pour salt water over the cabbage and add remaining 4 cups, stir to mix. If you can, place a plate or circular baking dish of sorts on top to submerge the cabbage (I used a pie dish), place something with a good amount of weight on top to hold down if necessary (it\u2019s not completely necessary but will help to evenly wilt the cabbage). Give cabbage a good mix every now and then. Let soak for 2 hours, up to 12 if you like. I found that 2 \u2013 4 hours was enough and didn\u2019t see much change between the two times.\nMake your seasonings: While cabbage is soaking, combine apple, onion, ginger and garlic in food processor/blender and process until fairly smooth.\nIn a small bowl, mix the chili pepper with a small amount of water to make a wet paste. You can just as easily blend it with the apple/onion mixture adding a couple tablespoons of water as well.\nMix everything together: Once cabbage is ready, drain water, reserving 1/2 cup, and rinse well. Place cabbage back in large bowl, combine with the scallions, apple/onion mixture and chili paste. Mix well to coat all pieces. Either use your hands (with gloves on pref to protect from the chili pepper) or simply use wooden spoons to toss everything.\nPacking: Place the kimchi in glass jars or containers with lid, pack down the best you can to close air pockets and leave about an inch at the top for air and gases. Top with remaining juices, add reserved brine if needed to cover vegetables.\nFermenting: Let kimchi sit at room temp (or in a cool place like a pantry or closet if weather is extremely warm) for 24 \u2013 36 hours. After 24 hours, open kimchi and pack the mixture down with a spoon (the cabbage will have likely shrunk and you\u2019ll have more liquids). You may notice it bubbling, this is perfectly normal as the kimchi is fermenting. As your kimchi ferments the flavors will develop, taste every 24 hours and place kimchi in the refrigerator once you\u2019re happy with the taste and to slow fermentation, usually after 36 \u2013 48 hours. It should be tangy, spicy and slightly sweet. After moving to the fridge, it\u2019s best used within a month, maybe two.\nMakes about 3 \u2013 4 cups\nServe with rice, use in Kimchi Fried Rice or make Kimchi Tofu Scramble!\n\n"

Let set for 2 hours. For a quick soak, place cashews in a bowl of warm water for 1 hour, or in near boiling water for 15 minutes. Drain and rinse well before blending. Use 2/3 cup of water instead of 3/4 cup, as the cashews will have plumped up and you may not need as much.
