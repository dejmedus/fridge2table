### Impact of food production

- Food production is responsible for nearly a third of all greenhouse gas emissions and requires half of all habitable land on earth. 
- Evidence shows that eating locally has little effect on the ecological impact of food, as transportation, refrigeration, and packaging accounts for only 5% of food's greenhouse gas emissions.
- However, studies show that we can significantly reduce our food's environmental footprint by incorporating more plant-based (meals without meat or dairy) into our diets!
